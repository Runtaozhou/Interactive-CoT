    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jeremy is driving 600 miles to visit his parents. His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour. Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for 15 minutes. His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how long it would take to drive 600 miles at 50 mph without any stops.
            <br>
            Time = Distance ÷ Speed = 600 miles ÷ 50 mph = 12 hours
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many rest stops Jeremy will make.
            <br>
            He makes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving.
            <br>
            Number of rest stops = Driving time ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 rest stops
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time spent at rest stops.
            <br>
            Time at rest stops = Number of rest stops × Time per rest stop = 6 × 15 minutes = 90 minutes
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many times Jeremy will need to refill gas.
            <br>
            First, let's find out how many gallons of gas he'll use for the entire trip.
            <br>
            Gallons needed = Distance ÷ Miles per gallon = 600 miles ÷ 18 mpg = 33.33 gallons
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many refill stops he'll need to make.
            <br>
            The gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, so he'll need to refill at that point.
            <br>
            Number of refills = 33.33 ÷ 15 = 2.22, which means he'll need to make 2 refill stops.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total time spent refilling.
            <br>
            Time refilling = Number of refills × Time per refill = 2 × 10 minutes = 20 minutes
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total trip time in minutes.
            <br>
            Total time = Driving time + Rest stop time + Refill time
            <br>
            = (12 hours × 60 minutes) + 90 minutes + 20 minutes
            <br>
            = 720 minutes + 90 minutes + 20 minutes
            <br>
            = 830 minutes
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        Jeremy will take 830 minutes to get to his parents' house.
