    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Iris' family is planning a surprise birthday party for her. The party will include her 3 uncles and 4 aunts who have a son and daughter each as well as her brother and mother. In total, how many people are coming to Iris' birthday party?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, I need to calculate the size of each aunt's and uncle's family. Each family unit consists of 1 son, 1 daughter, and 1 aunt/uncle.
            <br>
            Family unit size = 1 son + 1 daughter + 1 aunt/uncle = 3 people
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, I'll calculate the total number of aunts and uncles in Iris's family.
            <br>
            Total aunts and uncles = 3 uncles + 4 aunts = 7 aunts or uncles
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, I'll calculate the total number of people in all the aunts' and uncles' families.
            <br>
            Total extended family = 7 family units × 3 people per unit = 21 people
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Finally, I'll add Iris's mother and brother to get the total number of people attending the party.
            <br>
            Total attendees = 21 people from extended family + 1 mother + 1 brother = 23 people
        </div>
    </div>
