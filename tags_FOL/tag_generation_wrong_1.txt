## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Everyone working at Meta has a high income.</fact1>
<fact2>A person with a high income will not take a bus to their destination.</fact2>
<fact3>People will either take a bus or drive to their destination.</fact3>
<fact4>Everyone who has a car will choose to drive to their destination.</fact4>
<fact5>No students drive to their destination.</fact5>
<fact6>James has a car or works at Meta.</fact6>

Based on the given facts above, determine whether the following statement is true, false, or uncertain using deductive reasoning and give simple explanations. The statement is: James either drives to their destination or is a student.

## 2. Steps

<step1>Let's analyze what we know about James. <fact6>James has a car or works at Meta.</fact6></step1>

<step2>If James works at Meta, then <fact1>everyone working at Meta has a high income</fact1>, so James has a high income.</step2>

<step3>If James has a high income, then <fact2>a person with a high income will not take a bus to their destination</fact2>. So James will not take a bus.</step3>

<step4>Since <fact3>people will either take a bus or drive to their destination</fact3>, and James will not take a bus, James must drive to his destination.</step4>

<step5>If James has a car, then <fact4>everyone who has a car will choose to drive to their destination</fact4>. So James will drive to his destination.</step5>

<step6>So whether James has a car or works at Meta, he will drive to his destination.</step6>

<step7>We also know that <fact5>no students drive to their destination</fact5>. Since James drives to his destination, he cannot be a student.</step7>

<step8>Therefore, the statement "James either drives to their destination or is a student" is false, because James drives to his destination and is not a student.</step8>
