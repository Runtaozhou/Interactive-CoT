<fact1>Jean has 60 stuffies.</fact1> She keeps 1/3 of them and then gives away the rest. She gives 1/4 of what she gave away to her sister Janet. How many stuffies did Janet get?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total stuffies: 60</fact1>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many stuffies Jean kept </step1>
<formula> total_stuffies × (1/3) </formula>
<calculation> 60/3 = 20 stuffies </calculation>
<var> stuffies_kept : 20 stuffies </var>

<step2> Calculate how many stuffies Jean gave away </step2>
<formula> total_stuffies - stuffies_kept </formula>

<var> stuffies_given_away : 35 stuffies </var>

<step3> Calculate how many stuffies Janet received </step3>
<formula> stuffies_given_away × (1/4) </formula>
