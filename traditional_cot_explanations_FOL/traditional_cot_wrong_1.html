    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Everyone working at Meta has a high income.
        A person with a high income will not take a bus to their destination.
        People will either take a bus or drive to their destination.
        Everyone who has a car will choose to drive to their destination.
        No students drive to their destination.
        James has a car or works at Meta.

        Based on the given facts above, determine whether the following statement is true, false, or uncertain using deductive reasoning and give simple explanations. The statement is: James either drives to their destination or is a student.
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Analyze what we know about James
            <p>We know that James has a car or works at Meta.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Consider if James works at Meta
            <p>If James works at Meta, then everyone working at Meta has a high income, so James has a high income.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Determine what happens if James has a high income
            <p>If James has a high income, then a person with a high income will not take a bus to their destination. So James will not take a bus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Determine how James gets to his destination
            <p>Since people will either take a bus or drive to their destination, and James will not take a bus, James must drive to his destination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Consider if James has a car
            <p>If James has a car, then everyone who has a car will choose to drive to their destination. So James will drive to his destination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Combine the two possibilities
            <p>So whether James has a car or works at Meta, he will drive to his destination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Consider the fact about students
            <p>We also know that no students drive to their destination. Since James drives to his destination, he cannot be a student.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 8:</span> Evaluate the given statement
            <p>Therefore, the statement "James either drives to their destination or is a student" is false, because James drives to his destination and is not a student.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        False
