    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each and 8 wooden toys at $20 each from the crafts store to resell at a profit. However, when he sold the items, the selling price of a painting was 10% less and the selling price of a hat 15% less. Calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items.

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the loss per painting
            <p>To find the loss per painting, we need to calculate how much is lost due to the 10% discount.</p>
            <p>Loss per painting = (discount percentage/100) × cost per painting</p>
            <p>Loss per painting = 10/100 × $30 = $3</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total loss from selling all paintings
            <p>Now we need to multiply the loss per painting by the total number of paintings.</p>
            <p>Total painting loss = number of paintings × loss per painting</p>
            <p>Total painting loss = 10 × $3 = $30</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the loss per wooden toy
            <p>Similar to the paintings, we need to calculate the loss per wooden toy due to the 15% discount.</p>
            <p>Loss per wooden toy = (discount percentage/100) × cost per wooden toy</p>
            <p>Loss per wooden toy = 15/100 × $20 = $3</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total loss from selling all wooden toys
            <p>Now we multiply the loss per wooden toy by the total number of wooden toys.</p>
            <p>Total toy loss = number of wooden toys × loss per toy</p>
            <p>Total toy loss = 8 × $3 = $24</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total loss from all items
            <p>Finally, we add the total loss from paintings and the total loss from wooden toys.</p>
            <p>Total loss = total painting loss + total toy loss</p>
            <p>Total loss = $30 + $24 = $54</p>
        </div>
