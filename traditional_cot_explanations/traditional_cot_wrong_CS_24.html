    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Roger bought a house for $100,000. He was able to pay 20% down, and his parents paid off an additional 30% of the remaining balance. How much money does Roger still owe on his house?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Roger's down payment.
            <p>We need to find how much Roger paid as a down payment by multiplying the house price by the down payment percentage.</p>
            <p>Down payment = $100,000 × 20% = $100,000 × 0.20 = $20,000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the remaining balance after down payment.
            <p>We subtract the down payment from the house price to find the remaining balance.</p>
            <p>Remaining balance = $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the amount Roger's parents paid.
            <p>Roger's parents paid 30% of the remaining balance after the down payment.</p>
            <p>Parents' payment = $80,000 × 30% = $80,000 × 0.30 = $24,000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the final amount Roger still owes.
            <p>We subtract the parents' payment from the remaining balance to find how much Roger still owes.</p>
            <p>Final amount owed = $80,000 - $25,000 = $55,000</p>
        </div>
