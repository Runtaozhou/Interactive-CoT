    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Boris has 24 books and he donates a fourth of his books to the library. Cameron has 30 books and he donates a third of his books to the library. After donating their books, how many books in total do Boris and Cameron have together?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many books Boris donates.
            <p>Boris has 24 books and donates 1/4 of them.</p>
            <p>Number of books Boris donates = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 books</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many books Boris has left after donation.
            <p>Boris's remaining books = Total books - Donated books</p>
            <p>Boris's remaining books = 24 - 6 = 18 books</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add the additional books Boris found at home.
            <p>Boris's final book count = Remaining books + Additional books</p>
            <p>Boris's final book count = 18 + 2 = 20 books</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many books Cameron donates.
            <p>Cameron has 30 books and donates 1/3 of them.</p>
            <p>Number of books Cameron donates = 30 ÷ 3 = 10 books</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many books Cameron has left after donation.
            <p>Cameron's remaining books = Total books - Donated books</p>
            <p>Cameron's remaining books = 30 - 10 = 20 books</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total number of books Boris and Cameron have together.
            <p>Total books = Boris's final book count + Cameron's remaining books</p>
            <p>Total books = 20 + 20 = 40 books</p>
        </div>
