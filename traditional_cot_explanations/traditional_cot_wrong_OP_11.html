    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        John had a son James when he was 19. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. How old will John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Dora's current age.
            <p>Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is:</p>
            <p>12 - 3 = 9 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate James' current age based on Dora's age.
            <p>We know that James is twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is currently 9, James is:</p>
            <p>9 × 2 = 18 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate John's current age.
            <p>John was 19 when James was born, so John's current age is:</p>
            <p>19 + 18 = 37 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the youngest son's current age.
            <p>John was 32 when his youngest son was born. Since John is now 37, his youngest son is:</p>
            <p>37 - 32 = 5 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years.
            <p>The youngest son is currently 5 years old, so in 3 years he will be:</p>
            <p>5 + 3 = 8 years old</p>
