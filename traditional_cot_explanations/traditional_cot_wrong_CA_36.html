    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jackson wants to go on a shopping spree, so his mom says she will give him some spending money if he does extra chores. She promises $5 per hour spent on chores. Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and decides to do this twice. He also spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, and three times as long cleaning the bathroom. How much spending money has Jackson earned?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total time Jackson spent vacuuming.
            <p>Jackson spent 2 hours vacuuming and did this twice.</p>
            <p>Total vacuuming time = 2 hours × 2 = 4 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the money earned from vacuuming.
            <p>Jackson earns $5 per hour, so for vacuuming:</p>
            <p>Money earned from vacuuming = 4 hours × $5 per hour = $20</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the money earned from washing dishes.
            <p>Jackson spent 0.5 hours washing dishes.</p>
            <p>Money earned from washing dishes = 0.5 hours × $5 per hour = $2.5</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the time spent cleaning the bathroom.
            <p>Jackson spent three times as long cleaning the bathroom as washing dishes.</p>
            <p>Bathroom cleaning time = 0.5 hours × 3 = 1.5 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the money earned from cleaning the bathroom.
            <p>Money earned from bathroom cleaning = 1.5 hours × $5 per hour = $9</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total money earned from all chores.
            <p>Total money earned = $20 (vacuuming) + $2.5 (dishes) + $9 (bathroom) = $31.5</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        $31.5
