    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker can bake in one hour using all ovens.
            <p>The baker can bake 5 loaves per hour in one oven. With 4 ovens, he can bake:</p>
            <p>5 loaves per oven × 4 ovens = 20 loaves per hour</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes each weekday (Monday to Friday).
            <p>On weekdays, the baker bakes for 5 hours per day. In each hour, he bakes 20 loaves, so:</p>
            <p>5 hours × 20 loaves per hour = 100 loaves per weekday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked on all weekdays (Monday to Friday).
            <p>There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), and the baker bakes 100 loaves each weekday:</p>
            <p>100 loaves per weekday × 5 weekdays = 500 loaves on weekdays</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday).
            <p>On weekend days, the baker bakes for 2 hours. In each hour, he bakes 20 loaves, so:</p>
            <p>2 hours × 20 loaves per hour = 40 loaves per weekend day</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked on Saturday.
            <p>The baker bakes 40 loaves on Saturday:</p>
            <p>40 loaves per weekend day × 1 Saturday = 40 loaves on Saturday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked in one week.
            <p>The total loaves baked in one week is the sum of loaves baked on weekdays and Saturday:</p>
            <p>500 loaves on weekdays + 40 loaves on Saturday = 540 loaves per week</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked in three weeks.
            <p>The baker bakes 540 loaves per week, so in 3 weeks he bakes:</p>
            <p>540 loaves per week × 3 weeks = 1620 loaves in 3 weeks</p>
        </div>
    </div>
