    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch. When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile. The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas. How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many bananas Arnold stole the first time.
            <p>Arnold stole half of the 48 bananas that Gunther had.</p>
            <p>50 ÷ 2 = 25 bananas</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many bananas remained after the first theft.
            <p>We need to subtract the stolen bananas from the initial amount.</p>
            <p>48 - 25 = 23 bananas</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many bananas were in the pile after Gunther added more on day 2.
            <p>Gunther added 25 more bananas to the remaining 23.</p>
            <p>23 + 25 = 48 bananas</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many bananas remained after Arnold's second theft.
            <p>Arnold stole 12 more bananas from the pile of 48.</p>
            <p>48 - 12 = 36 bananas</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the final number of bananas after Gunther's day 3 addition.
            <p>Gunther added 6 more bananas to the remaining 36.</p>
            <p>36 + 6 = 42 bananas</p>
