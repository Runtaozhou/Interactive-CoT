    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A store decides to shut down and sell all of its inventory. They have 2000 different items which would normally retail for $50. They are offering an 80% discount and manage to sell 90% of the items. They owed $15000 to their creditors. How much money do they have left after the sale?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of items sold.
            <p>We need to find how many items were sold by multiplying the total number of items by the percentage sold:</p>
            <p>Total items × Percentage sold = 2000 × 0.9 = 1800 items</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the discount amount per item.
            <p>We need to find the discount amount by dividing the normal price by the discount percentage:</p>
            <p>Normal price / Discount percentage = $50 / 0.8 = $62.50</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the selling price per item after discount.
            <p>We need to find the selling price after discount by subtracting the discount amount from the normal price:</p>
            <p>Normal price - Discount amount = $50 - $62.50 = $-12.50</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total revenue from the sale.
            <p>We need to find the total revenue by multiplying the number of items sold by the selling price:</p>
            <p>Items sold × Selling price = 1800 × $-12.50 = $-22,500</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the money left after paying creditors.
            <p>We need to find how much money is left by subtracting the money owed to creditors from the total revenue:</p>
            <p>Total revenue - Money owed = $-22,500 - $15,000 = $-37,500</p>
        </div>
