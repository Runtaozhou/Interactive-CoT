    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Danivan Drugstore has 4500 bottles of hand sanitizer gel in inventory at the beginning of the week. On Monday 2445 bottles were sold, on Tuesday 900 bottles were sold, and 50 bottles each day for the rest of the week were sold (from Wednesday until Sunday). On Saturday, the supplier delivers an order for 650 bottles. How many bottles of sanitizer gel does the Drugstore have at the end of the week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday.
            <p>We need to add the sales from Monday and Tuesday:</p>
            <p>Monday sales + Tuesday sales = 2445 + 900 = 3345 bottles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total bottles sold from Wednesday to Sunday.
            <p>We need to multiply the daily sales by the number of days:</p>
            <p>Daily sales × Number of days = 50 × 4 = 200 bottles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total bottles sold during the week.
            <p>We add the sales from Monday-Tuesday and Wednesday-Sunday:</p>
            <p>Monday-Tuesday sales + Wednesday-Sunday sales = 3345 + 200 = 3545 bottles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the remaining inventory before Saturday delivery.
            <p>We subtract the total sales from the starting inventory:</p>
            <p>Starting inventory - Total sales = 4500 - 3545 = 955 bottles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the final inventory after Saturday delivery.
            <p>We add the Saturday delivery to the remaining inventory:</p>
            <p>Remaining inventory + Saturday delivery = 955 + 650 = 1605 bottles</p>
        </div>
