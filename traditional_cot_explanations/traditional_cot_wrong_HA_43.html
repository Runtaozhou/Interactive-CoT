    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Monika went out for the day and spent some money. She went to the mall and spent $250. Then, she went to the movies and watched 3 movies back to back that each cost $24. Then she stopped by the farmer's market on her way home and got 20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag. How much money did Monika spend throughout her day?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much Monika spent at the movies.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of movies by the cost per movie:</p>
            <p>3 movies × $24 per movie = $72</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Add the cost of drinks that Monika bought at the movies.
            <p>We need to add the movie cost to the cost of drinks (one drink per movie):</p>
            <p>$72 + (3 movies × $3 per drink) = $72 + $9 = $81</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much Monika spent at the farmers market.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:</p>
            <p>20 bags × $1.25 per bag = $25</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total amount Monika spent throughout the day.
            <p>We need to add all the expenses:</p>
            <p>Mall cost + Total movie cost + Farmers market cost = $250 + $81 + $25 = $356</p>
        </div>
