    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A local college is offering German lessons and currently has 8 students enrolled. Through advertising, 8 more became interested but a fourth of these dropped out within a day. 2 more got frustrated and left. The class then rallied to show how simple the course actually is and increased enrollment by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled in the class, but 2 had to drop it because of scheduling conflicts. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of students after the initial advertising.
            <p>We start with 8 students, and 8 more became interested through advertising.</p>
            <p>Initial students + New interested students = 8 + 8 = 16 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many new students dropped out within a day.
            <p>A fourth (25%) of the 8 new interested students dropped out within a day.</p>
            <p>New students × Dropout rate = 8 × 0.25 = 2 students dropped out</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of students after initial dropouts.
            <p>From our 16 students, 2 dropped out within a day, and 2 more got frustrated and left.</p>
            <p>Total after advertising - Initial dropouts - Additional dropouts = 16 - 2 - 2 = 12 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the number of students after the first rally.
            <p>The enrollment increased by 5 times the amount of students already enrolled (12 students).</p>
            <p>Students after dropouts × (1 + Enrollment increase factor) = 12 × 5 + 12 = 72 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the number of students after scheduling conflicts.
            <p>After the rally, 2 students had to drop due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
            <p>Students after rally × 2 = 72 × 2 = 144 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the number of students after the final rally.
            <p>After the final rally, 6 more people enrolled.</p>
            <p>Students after conflicts + Final rally enrollments = 144 + 6 = 150 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the number of students after half dropped out.
            <p>As days passed, half of the class eventually dropped out.</p>
            <p>Total enrolled ÷ 2 = 150 ÷ 2 = 75 students</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 8:</span> Calculate the number of students still enrolled after graduation.
            <p>Half of the remaining students graduated, leaving the other half still enrolled.</p>
            <p>Students after dropouts ÷ 2 = 75 ÷ 2 = 37.5 students</p>
        </div>
