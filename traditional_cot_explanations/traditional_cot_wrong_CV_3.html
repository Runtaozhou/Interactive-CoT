    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The government gives the bottom 20% of people a $2000 stimulus. They have found that this kind of stimulus returns 5 times as much money to the government, in terms of tax revenue, as it cost. The city has 1000 people in it. What was the government profit from this project?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many people receive the stimulus.
            <p>We need to find 20% of the total population:</p>
            <p>Total people × percentage = 1000 × 0.2 = 200 people</p>
            <p>So, 200 people will receive the stimulus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total cost of the stimulus.
            <p>We multiply the number of recipients by the stimulus amount:</p>
            <p>Recipients × stimulus amount = 200 × $2500 = $500,000</p>
            <p>The total cost of the stimulus is $500,000.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the money returned to the government.
            <p>The stimulus returns 5 times as much money as it cost:</p>
            <p>Total cost × return multiplier = $500,000 × 5 = $2,500,000</p>
            <p>The government receives $2,500,000 in return.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the government profit.
            <p>Profit is the difference between the return and the cost:</p>
            <p>Total return - total cost = $2,500,000 - $500,000 = $2,000,000</p>
            <p>The government's profit from this project is $2,000,000.</p>
        </div>
