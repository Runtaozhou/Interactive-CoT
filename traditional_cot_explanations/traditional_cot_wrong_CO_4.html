    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        It's exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many hours Tristan studies on Tuesday.
            <p>Since Tristan studies twice as long on Tuesday as he does on Monday, we multiply Monday's hours by 2.</p>
            <p>Tuesday's study time = 4 hours × 2 = 8 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total hours studied in the first five days.
            <p>We need to add up all the hours from Monday through Friday:</p>
            <p>Monday: 4 hours</p>
            <p>Tuesday: 8 hours</p>
            <p>Wednesday: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Thursday: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Friday: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Total weekday hours = 4 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the remaining hours to be divided between Saturday and Sunday.
            <p>Tristan wants to study for a total of 25 hours, so we subtract the weekday hours from the total:</p>
            <p>Remaining weekend hours = 25 hours - 21 hours = 4 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many hours Tristan studies on Saturday.
            <p>The remaining 4 hours are divided by 1 to get Saturday's hours:</p>
            <p>Saturday hours = 4 hours ÷ 1 = 4 hours</p>
        </div>
