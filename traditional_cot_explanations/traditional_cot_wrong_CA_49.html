    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Out of the 80 students who took the biology exam, only 2/5 of them managed to score 100%. If a score below 80% qualified as failing, and 50 percent of the remaining students who didn't score 100% managed to score over 80%, calculate the number of students who failed the exam.
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of students who scored 100%
            <p>We need to find how many students scored 100% on the exam.</p>
            <p>Total students × Fraction scoring 100% = 80 × 2/5 = 32 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find the number of students who did not score 100%
            <p>We need to determine how many students scored less than 100%.</p>
            <p>Total students - Students with 100% = 80 - 32 = 48 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of students who scored over 80% but below 100%
            <p>We know that 50% of the remaining students scored over 80% but below 100%.</p>
            <p>Percentage of remaining students scoring over 80% × Students without 100% = 50/100 × 48 = 23 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the number of students who failed (scored below 80%)
            <p>Now we can find how many students failed the exam by subtracting those who scored over 80% from those who didn't score 100%.</p>
            <p>Students without 100% - Students over 80% = 48 - 23 = 25 students</p>
        </div>
    </div>
