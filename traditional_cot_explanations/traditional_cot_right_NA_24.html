    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Two stores sell the same model of smartphone, but they offer it at different prices and with different discounts. Store A lists the smartphone at a full price of $125 and offers an additional discount of 8%. Store B lists the same smartphone for $130 and offers an additional discount of 10%. After both stores' discounts are applied, how much cheaper is store A's smartphone than store B's smartphone?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the discount amount for Store A.
            <p>We need to find how much discount Store A offers on the smartphone.</p>
            <p>Store A discount = Store A price × discount percentage / 100</p>
            <p>Store A discount = $125 × 8/100 = $10</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the final price at Store A after discount.
            <p>Now we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price at Store A.</p>
            <p>Store A final price = Store A price - Store A discount</p>
            <p>Store A final price = $125 - $10 = $115</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the discount amount for Store B.
            <p>Similarly, we need to find how much discount Store B offers on the smartphone.</p>
            <p>Store B discount = Store B price × discount percentage / 100</p>
            <p>Store B discount = $130 × 10/100 = $13</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the final price at Store B after discount.
            <p>Now we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price at Store B.</p>
            <p>Store B final price = Store B price - Store B discount</p>
            <p>Store B final price = $130 - $13 = $117</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Find the price difference between Store B and Store A.
            <p>To determine how much cheaper Store A's smartphone is compared to Store B's, we subtract Store A's final price from Store B's final price.</p>
            <p>Price difference = Store B final price - Store A final price</p>
            <p>Price difference = $117 - $115 = $2</p>
