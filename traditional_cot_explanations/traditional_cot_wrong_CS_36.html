    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Prudence was starting a cupcake business. She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make. The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out. The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away. Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of dozen cupcakes made.
            <p>We need to add all batches of cupcakes: burnt batch + first good batch + second batch</p>
            <p>2 + 2 + 2 = 6 dozen cupcakes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Convert dozens to individual cupcakes.
            <p>Total cupcakes = Total dozen × 12</p>
            <p>6 × 12 = 72 cupcakes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many cupcakes were burnt.
            <p>Burnt cupcakes = Burnt dozen × 12</p>
            <p>2 × 12 = 24 cupcakes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many cupcakes remain after losses.
            <p>Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes - Burnt cupcakes - First eating - Second eating</p>
            <p>72 - 24 - 5 - 4 = 39 cupcakes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining cupcakes.
            <p>Revenue = Remaining cupcakes × Selling price</p>
            <p>39 × $2.00 = $78.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total cost of making all cupcakes.
            <p>Total cost = Total cupcakes × Cost per cupcake</p>
            <p>70 × $0.75 = $52.50</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the net profit.
            <p>Net profit = Revenue - Total cost</p>
            <p>$78.00 - $52.50 = $25.50</p>
        </div>
