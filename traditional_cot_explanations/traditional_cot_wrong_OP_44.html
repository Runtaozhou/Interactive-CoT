    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Chris wanted to buy a new video game that costs $60 as well as an assortment of candy that costs $5. To earn the money, he agreed to babysit his little sister for $8 per hour. If he works 9 hours, how much money will be left over after he makes his purchases?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total cost of the purchases.
            <p>We need to find how much Chris needs to spend in total.</p>
            <p>Video game cost: $60</p>
            <p>Candy cost: $5</p>
            <p>Total cost = $60 - $5 = $55</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much money Chris earned from babysitting.
            <p>Chris earns $8 per hour and works for 9 hours.</p>
            <p>Money earned = $8 × 9 = $72</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much money Chris has left after making his purchases.
            <p>Now we can find the difference between what Chris earned and what he spent.</p>
            <p>Money left = $72 - $55 = $17</p>
        </div>
    </div>
