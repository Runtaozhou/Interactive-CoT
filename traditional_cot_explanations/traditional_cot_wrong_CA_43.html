    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Sandra wants to buy some sweets. She saved $10 for this purpose. Her mother gave her an additional $4, and her father twice as much as her mother. One candy costs $0.5, and one jelly bean $0.2. She wants to buy 14 candies and 20 jelly beans. How much money will she be left with after the purchase?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much money Sandra's father gave her.
            <p>Since her father gave her twice as much as her mother, and her mother gave her $4:</p>
            <p>Money from father = Money from mother × 2 = $4 × 2 = $8</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total amount of money Sandra has.
            <p>We need to add her savings, the money from her mother, and the money from her father:</p>
            <p>Total money = Savings + Money from mother + Money from father = $10 + $4 + $8 = $22</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the cost of the candies.
            <p>Sandra wants to buy 14 candies at $0.50 each:</p>
            <p>Cost of candies = Number of candies × Cost per candy = 14 × $0.50 = $7</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the cost of the jelly beans.
            <p>Sandra wants to buy 20 jelly beans at $0.20 each:</p>
            <p>Cost of jelly beans = Number of jelly beans × Cost per jelly bean = 20 × $0.20 = $4</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the amount of money left after the purchase.
            <p>We subtract the cost of candies and jelly beans from the total money:</p>
            <p>Money left = Total money - Cost of jelly beans - Cost of candies = $22 - $4 - $7 = $10</p>
        </div>
    </div>
