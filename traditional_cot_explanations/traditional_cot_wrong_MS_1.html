    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Loisa wants to buy a tablet that costs $450 cash. Since she does not have enough money, the store offered her an installment plan for 12 months. She will pay $100 as a down payment and pay $40 for the first 4 months; then $35 for the next four months; then $30 for the last four months. How much will Loisa save if she will buy the tablet in cash instead of on installment?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total payment for the first 4 months.
            <p>We need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:</p>
            <p>$40 × 4 = $160</p>
            <p>So, the total payment for the first 4 months is $160.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total payment for the next 4 months.
            <p>We need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:</p>
            <p>$35 × 4 = $140</p>
            <p>So, the total payment for the next 4 months is $140.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total payment for the last 4 months.
            <p>We need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:</p>
            <p>$30 × 4 = $120</p>
            <p>So, the total payment for the last 4 months is $120.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total installment payment including down payment.
            <p>We add the down payment and all monthly payments:</p>
            <p>$100 + $160 + $160 + $120 = $540</p>
            <p>So, the total cost of the tablet on installment is $540.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how much Loisa will save by paying cash.
            <p>We subtract the cash price from the total installment cost:</p>
            <p>$540 - $450 = $90</p>
            <p>So, Loisa will save $90 by paying cash instead of using the installment plan.</p>
