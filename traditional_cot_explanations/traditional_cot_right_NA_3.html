    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Bob grew corn in his garden this year and ended up with 50 bushels. This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to convert Stacy's ears of corn to bushels so we can calculate the total bushels Bob gave away.
            <br>
            Stacy took 21 ears of corn. Since each bushel contains 14 ears of corn, we divide:
            <br>
            21 ears ÷ 14 ears/bushel = 1.5 bushels
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now we can calculate the total bushels Bob gave away to all his friends.
            <br>
            Terry took 8 bushels
            <br>
            Jerry took 3 bushels
            <br>
            Linda took 12 bushels
            <br>
            Stacy took 1.5 bushels
            <br>
            Total given away = 8 + 3 + 12 + 1.5 = 24.5 bushels
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, we calculate how many bushels Bob has left after giving corn away.
            <br>
            Bob started with 50 bushels and gave away 24.5 bushels.
            <br>
            Remaining bushels = 50 - 24.5 = 25.5 bushels
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Finally, we need to convert the remaining bushels to ears of corn, which is what the question asks for.
            <br>
            Since each bushel contains 14 ears of corn:
            <br>
            Remaining ears of corn = 25.5 bushels × 14 ears per bushel = 357 ears
        </div>
    </div>

        357
