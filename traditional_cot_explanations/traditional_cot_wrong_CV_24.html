    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Levi has 5 lemons. Jayden has 6 more lemons than Levi. Jayden has one-third as many lemons as Eli has while Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian has. How many lemons do they have in all?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many lemons Jayden has.
            <p>Since Jayden has 6 more lemons than Levi, and Levi has 5 lemons:</p>
            <p>Jayden's lemons = Levi's lemons + 6 = 5 + 6 = 11 lemons</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many lemons Eli has.
            <p>Since Jayden has one-third as many lemons as Eli, we need to multiply Jayden's lemons by 3:</p>
            <p>Eli's lemons = Jayden's lemons × 3 = 8 × 3 = 24 lemons</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many lemons Ian has.
            <p>Since Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian, we need to multiply Eli's lemons by 2:</p>
            <p>Ian's lemons = Eli's lemons × 2 = 24 × 2 = 48 lemons</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of lemons.
            <p>We add up all the lemons from each person:</p>
            <p>Total lemons = Levi's lemons + Jayden's lemons + Eli's lemons + Ian's lemons</p>
            <p>Total lemons = 5 + 11 + 24 + 48 = 88 lemons</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        88
