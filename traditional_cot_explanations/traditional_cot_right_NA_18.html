    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Christina walks 7km to school every day from Monday to Friday. She returns home covering the same distance. Last Friday her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite distance from home. How many kilometers did Christina cover that week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the distance for one round trip to school.
            <p>Christina walks 7km to school and then 7km back home each day.</p>
            <p>Distance for one round trip = 7km × 2 = 14km</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total distance for the week (Monday to Friday).
            <p>Christina makes this round trip 5 days a week (Monday to Friday).</p>
            <p>Weekly distance = 14km/day × 5 days = 70km</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the extra distance to visit her friend.
            <p>On Friday, Christina had to go an extra 2km from school to visit her friend, and then 2km back to continue her journey home.</p>
            <p>Extra distance = 2km × 2 = 4km</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total distance for the week including the visit to her friend.
            <p>We add the regular weekly distance to the extra distance for visiting her friend.</p>
            <p>Total distance = 70km + 4km = 74km</p>
        </div>
