    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Adam goes to school every day. On Monday he had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each, and on Tuesday he had 3 lessons of 1 hour each. On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday. How much time in total did Adam spend at school during these 3 days, in hours?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Monday in hours.
            <p>To find this, we multiply the number of lessons by the minutes per lesson, then convert to hours:</p>
            <p>6 lessons × 30 minutes per lesson = 180 minutes</p>
            <p>180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours</p>
            <p>So Adam spent 3 hours at school on Monday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Wednesday.
            <p>According to the problem, Adam spent twice as much time at school on Wednesday as on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Tuesday time: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Wednesday time: 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 hours</p>
            <p>So Adam spent 1.5 hours at school on Wednesday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time Adam spent at school during the three days.
            <p>We add up the hours from all three days:</p>
            <p>Monday: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Tuesday: 3 hours</p>
            <p>Wednesday: 1.5 hours</p>
            <p>Total time: 3 + 3 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours</p>
        </div>
    </div>
