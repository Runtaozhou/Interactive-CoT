    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        At a convention, 16 of 36 delegates arrived with pre-printed name badges. Half of the remaining delegates made their own, hand-written name badges. How many delegates were not wearing name badges?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many delegates did not have pre-printed name badges.
            <p>We need to subtract the number of delegates with pre-printed badges from the total number of delegates:</p>
            <p>Total delegates - Delegates with pre-printed badges = 36 - 16 = 20</p>
            <p>So, 20 delegates did not have pre-printed name badges.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many delegates made hand-written badges.
            <p>Half of the delegates without pre-printed badges made hand-written badges:</p>
            <p>Delegates without pre-printed badges * 1/2 = 20 * 2 = 40</p>
            <p>Therefore, 40 delegates made hand-written badges.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many delegates had no name badge.
            <p>We need to subtract the number of delegates with hand-written badges from the number of delegates without pre-printed badges:</p>
            <p>Delegates without pre-printed badges - Delegates with hand-written badges = 20 - 40 = -20</p>
            <p>So, -20 delegates had no name badge.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        -20
