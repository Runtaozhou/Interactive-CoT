    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total revenue for Thursday.
            <p>We need to add the revenue from truck tires and car tires:</p>
            <p>(Number of truck tires × truck tire cost) + (number of car tires × car tire cost)</p>
            <p>6 × $40 + 4 × $40 = $400</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total revenue for Friday.
            <p>On Friday, the mechanic only repaired car tires:</p>
            <p>Number of car tires × car tire cost</p>
            <p>12 × $40 = $480</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Find the difference between the revenues of the two days.
            <p>Thursday revenue - Friday revenue</p>
            <p>$400 - $480 = -$80</p>
            <p>Since we got a negative number, Friday had the higher revenue. The difference is $80.</p>
