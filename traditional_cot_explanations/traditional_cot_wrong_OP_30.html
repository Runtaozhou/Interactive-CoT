    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Frank picked 36 apples. Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank. Susan gave out half of her apples, and Frank sold a third of his, how many in total do they have left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many apples Susan picked.
            <p>Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank.</p>
            <p>Frank picked 36 apples.</p>
            <p>So, Susan picked: 3 × 36 = 108 apples</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many apples Susan gave out.
            <p>Susan gave out half of her apples.</p>
            <p>Susan gave out: 108 ÷ (1/2) = 216 apples</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many apples Susan has left.
            <p>Susan's remaining apples = Total apples - Apples given out</p>
            <p>Susan's remaining apples = 108 - 216 = -108 apples</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many apples Frank sold.
            <p>Frank sold a third of his apples.</p>
            <p>Frank sold: 36 × (1/3) = 12 apples</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many apples Frank has left.
            <p>Frank's remaining apples = Total apples - Apples sold</p>
            <p>Frank's remaining apples = 36 - 12 = 24 apples</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total number of apples they have left.
            <p>Total apples left = Susan's remaining apples + Frank's remaining apples</p>
            <p>Total apples left = -108 + 24 = -84 apples</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        -84
