    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total rain on Monday.
            <p>Monday had 2 inches in the morning plus 1 more inch later in the day.</p>
            <p>2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches of rain on Monday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total rain on Tuesday.
            <p>Tuesday had twice as much rain as Monday.</p>
            <p>2 × 3 inches = 6 inches of rain on Tuesday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total rain across Wednesday and Thursday.
            <p>Wednesday had no rain, and Thursday had 1 inch of rain.</p>
            <p>0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch of rain for Wednesday and Thursday combined</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total rain on Friday.
            <p>Friday's rain was equal to Monday through Thursday combined.</p>
            <p>3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 1 inch (Wed & Thurs) = 10 inches of rain on Friday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total rain for the week.
            <p>Add up the rain from all days of the week.</p>
            <p>3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 1 inch (Wed & Thurs) + 10 inches (Friday) = 20 inches total</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the average daily rain.
            <p>Divide the total rain by the number of days.</p>
            <p>20 inches ÷ 4 days = 5 inches per day on average</p>
