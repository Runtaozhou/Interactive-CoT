    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        To celebrate a recent promotion, Arthur decided to treat himself to dinner at a nice restaurant. He ordered a nice appetizer for $8, a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20, had two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each, and a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6. He used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total cost of the meal before the voucher.
            <p>We need to add up all the items Arthur ordered:</p>
            <p>Appetizer: $8</p>
            <p>Ribeye steak (entrée): $20</p>
            <p>Two glasses of wine: 2 × $3 = $6</p>
            <p>Caramel cheesecake: $6</p>
            <p>Total cost before voucher = $8 + $20 + $6 + $6 = $40</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the tip amount based on the full cost.
            <p>Arthur tipped 20% of what the full cost would have been without the discount:</p>
            <p>Tip amount = $44 × 0.20 = $8.8</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the discount from the voucher.
            <p>The voucher gives half off the price of the entrée:</p>
            <p>Discount = $20 ÷ 2 = $10</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the final cost including tip and after discount.
            <p>We take the full meal cost, subtract the voucher discount, and add the tip:</p>
            <p>Final cost = $44 - $10 + $8.8 = $42.8</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        $42.8
