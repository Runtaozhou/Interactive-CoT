    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jim decides to open up a bike shop. The most common repair he does is fixing bike tires. He charges $20 for this and it cost him $5 in parts. In one month Jim does 300 of these repairs. He also does 2 more complex repairs for $300 each and cost $50 in parts. He also sells $2000 profit worth of things from his retail shop.

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the profit per tire repair.
            <p>For each tire repair, Jim charges $20 and spends $5 on parts.</p>
            <p>Profit per tire repair = $20 - $5 = $15</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total profit from tire repairs.
            <p>Jim does 300 tire repairs in a month, each with a $15 profit.</p>
            <p>Total profit from tire repairs = $15 × 300 = $4,500</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the profit per complex repair.
            <p>For each complex repair, Jim charges $300 and spends $50 on parts.</p>
            <p>Profit per complex repair = $300 - $50 = $250</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total profit from complex repairs.
            <p>Jim does 2 complex repairs, each with a $250 profit.</p>
            <p>Total profit from complex repairs = $250 × 2 = $500</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total profit from all sources including a parking fine.
            <p>We need to add the profits from tire repairs, complex repairs, and retail sales, then subtract the fine.</p>
            <p>Total income = $4,500 + $500 + $2,000 - $300 = $6,700</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the final profit after fixed expenses.
            <p>We need to subtract the monthly fixed expenses from the total income.</p>
            <p>Final profit = $6,700 - $4,000 = $2,700</p>
        </div>
