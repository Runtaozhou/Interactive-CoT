    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> We start by identifying that the top level has one case. Since each level's side length increases by 1 case as we go down, the second level will have a side length of 2 cases.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> For the second level, we need to calculate how many cases are needed. Since it has a square base with side length 2, we calculate:
            <br>2 cases × 2 cases = 4 cases for the second level
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> For the third level, the side length is 3 cases. To find the number of cases, we add the side length four times:
            <br>3 cases + 3 cases + 3 cases + 3 cases = 12 cases for the third level
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> For the fourth level, the side length is 4 cases. Since it has a square base, we calculate:
            <br>4 cases × 4 cases = 16 cases for the fourth level
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Finally, we add up all the cases from each level to find the total number of cases Mark needs:
            <br>1 case (top level) + 4 cases (second level) + 12 cases (third level) + 16 cases (fourth level) = 33 cases
        </div>
    </div>
