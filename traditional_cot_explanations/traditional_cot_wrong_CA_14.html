    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate the number of thank you cards Valerie needs to mail. She needs to send cards to her grandmother, uncle, and aunt, which means she has 3 thank you cards.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Next, we need to identify the number of bills Valerie has to mail. She has to pay the water bill and the electric bill, so that's 2 bills in total.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Now, let's calculate the number of mail-in rebates based on the number of bills. The problem states that she wants to send three more mail-in rebates than bills. So the number of rebates is:
            <br>Bills + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 mail-in rebates
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Next, we need to calculate the number of job applications based on the number of rebates. The problem states that she has twice as many job applications as rebates. So the number of job applications is:
            <br>Rebates × 2 = 5 × 2 = 10 job applications
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of mail Valerie needs to send:
            <br>Thank you cards + Bills + Rebates + Applications = 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Finally, we need to calculate the total number of stamps needed. Each piece of mail requires 1 stamp, except for the electric bill which requires 2 stamps. So the total number of stamps is:
            <br>Total mail + Extra stamp for electric bill = 20 + 1 = 21 stamps
        </div>
    </div>
