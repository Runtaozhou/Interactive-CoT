    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jeremy is driving 600 miles to visit his parents. His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour. Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for 15 minutes. His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total driving time in minutes.
            <p>To find the driving time, we divide the total distance by the speed:</p>
            <p>Driving time = 600 miles ÷ 50 miles per hour = 12 hours</p>
            <p>Converting to minutes: 12 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Determine the number of rest stops needed.
            <p>Jeremy takes a rest stop every 2 hours of driving. With 12 hours of total driving time, we calculate:</p>
            <p>12 hours ÷ 2 hours = 6 rest stops</p>
            <p>However, he actually takes 5 rest stops at the 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hour marks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time spent at rest stops.
            <p>Each rest stop takes 15 minutes, so:</p>
            <p>Total rest time = 5 rest stops × 15 minutes = 75 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how far Jeremy can drive before needing to refuel.
            <p>With a fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon and the gas indicator coming on after using 15 gallons:</p>
            <p>Distance per tank = 18 miles per gallon × 15 gallons = 270 miles</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Determine how many times Jeremy needs to refuel.
            <p>Total refuels needed = 600 miles ÷ 270 miles per tank = 2.22 refuels</p>
            <p>Since Jeremy can't partially refuel, he'll need to stop for gas 2 times during the trip.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total time spent refueling.
            <p>Each refueling stop takes 10 minutes:</p>
            <p>Total refueling time = 2 refuels × 10 minutes = 20 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total trip time.
            <p>We add up all the time components:</p>
            <p>Total trip time = 720 minutes driving + 75 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = 815 minutes</p>
        </div>
