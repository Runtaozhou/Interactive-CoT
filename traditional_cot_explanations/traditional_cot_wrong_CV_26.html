    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the weekly pay for each employee.
            <p>Each employee earns $15 per hour and works 40 hours per week.</p>
            <p>Weekly pay = $15 × 40 hours = $600 per week</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the monthly pay for each employee.
            <p>Assuming 4 weeks in a month:</p>
            <p>Monthly pay = $600 per week × 4 weeks = $2,400 per month</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May.
            <p>In May, the company had 40 employees.</p>
            <p>May total = 35 employees × $2,400 = $84,000</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many employees' contracts expired in June.
            <p>1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.</p>
            <p>Expired contracts = 1/4 × 40 employees = 10 employees</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the number of employees with valid contracts in June.
            <p>June employees = 40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June.
            <p>June total = 30 employees × $2,400 = $72,000</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total amount paid over both months.
            <p>Total payment = May total + June total = $84,000 + $72,000 = $156,000</p>
        </div>
