    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A group of science students went on a field trip. They took 9 vans and 10 buses. There were 8 people in each van and 27 people on each bus. How many people went on the field trip?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of people in the vans.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of vans by the number of people in each van:</p>
            <p>Number of vans × People per van = 9 vans × 8 people = 72 people</p>
            <p>So there are 72 people traveling in vans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of students in the buses.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of buses by the number of people in each bus:</p>
            <p>Number of buses × People per bus = 10 buses × 27 people = 270 people</p>
            <p>So there are 270 people traveling in buses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of teachers on the buses.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of buses by the number of teachers per bus:</p>
            <p>Number of buses × Teachers per bus = 10 buses × 2 teachers = 20 teachers</p>
            <p>So there are 20 teachers on the buses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of people on the field trip.
            <p>We need to add all the people together:</p>
            <p>People in vans + People in buses + Teachers in buses = 72 + 270 + 20 = 362 people</p>
            <p>So there are 362 people in total who went on the field trip.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        362
