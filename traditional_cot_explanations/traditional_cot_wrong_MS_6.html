    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Find Vince's age two years ago based on Liam's age two years ago.
            <p>First, I need to determine how old Liam was two years ago:</p>
            <p>Liam's age two years ago = 16 - 2 = 14 years old</p>
            <p>Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age at that time:</p>
            <p>Vince's age two years ago = 14 ÷ 2 = 7 years old</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Vince's current age by adding 2 years to his age from two years ago.
            <p>Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2</p>
            <p>Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9 years old</p>
            <p>However, based on our calculation, Vince's current age is 10 years old.</p>
        </div>
