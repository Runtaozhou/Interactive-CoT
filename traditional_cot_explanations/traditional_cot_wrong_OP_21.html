    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate the number of thank you cards Valerie needs to mail. She needs to send cards to her grandmother, uncle, and aunt, which is 3 people total. So she has 3 thank you cards.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Next, we need to identify the number of bills Valerie needs to mail. She has the water bill and the electric bill, which means she has 2 bills to mail.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Now, let's calculate the number of mail-in rebates based on the relationship with bills. The problem states that she wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills. Since she has 2 bills, she will send 3 - 2 = 1 mail-in rebate.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Next, we need to calculate the number of job applications based on the relationship with rebates. She has twice as many job applications as rebates. Since she has 1 rebate, she will have 2 × 1 = 2 job applications.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Now, let's sum up all the pieces of mail Valerie needs to send. She has 3 thank you cards, 2 bills, 1 rebate, and 2 job applications. In total, that's 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8 pieces of mail.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Finally, we need to calculate the total number of stamps needed. Each piece of mail requires 1 stamp, except for the electric bill which needs 2 stamps. So we need 8 stamps for the 8 pieces of mail, plus 1 extra stamp for the electric bill, for a total of 8 + 1 = 9 stamps.
