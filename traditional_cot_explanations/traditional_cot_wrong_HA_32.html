    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Patrick has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time that Greg has left to finish his homework. Greg has six hours less than Jacob left to finish his homework. If Jacob has 18 hours left to finish his homework, calculate the total number of hours they all have left to finish their homework?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much time Greg has left by subtracting from Jacob's time.
            <p>We know that Greg has 6 hours less than Jacob, and Jacob has 18 hours left.</p>
            <p>Greg's time = Jacob's time - 6 hours - 2 hours</p>
            <p>Greg's time = 18 - 6 - 2 = 10 hours</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total time for Jacob and Greg.
            <p>Now we add Jacob's time and Greg's time to find their combined total.</p>
            <p>Jacob and Greg's total = Jacob's time + Greg's time</p>
            <p>Jacob and Greg's total = 18 + 10 = 28 hours</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Patrick's time based on Greg's time.
            <p>Patrick has 4 hours less than twice Greg's time.</p>
            <p>Patrick's time = (2 × Greg's time) - 4 hours</p>
            <p>Patrick's time = (2 × 10) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 hours</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total time for all three people.
            <p>We add Patrick's time to the total time of Jacob and Greg.</p>
            <p>Total time = Jacob and Greg's total + Patrick's time</p>
            <p>Total time = 28 + 16 = 44 hours</p>
        </div>
