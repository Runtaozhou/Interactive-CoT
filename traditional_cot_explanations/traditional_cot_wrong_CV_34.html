    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Three siblings are born 5 years apart, each. If the eldest child is 20 years old now, what's the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the eldest child's age 10 years from now.
            <p>The eldest child is currently 20 years old. In 10 years, they will be:</p>
            <p>20 + 10 = 30 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the second child's current age.
            <p>Since the siblings are born 5 years apart, the second child is 5 years younger than the eldest:</p>
            <p>25 - 5 = 20 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the second child's age 10 years from now.
            <p>The second child is currently 20 years old. In 10 years, they will be:</p>
            <p>20 + 10 = 30 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total age of the first and second-born 10 years from now.
            <p>Adding the future ages of the eldest and second child:</p>
            <p>30 + 30 = 60 years</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the third child's current age.
            <p>The third child is 5 years younger than the second child:</p>
            <p>20 - 5 = 15 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the third child's age 10 years from now.
            <p>The third child is currently 15 years old. In 10 years, they will be:</p>
            <p>15 + 10 = 25 years old</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total age of all three siblings 10 years from now.
            <p>Adding the future ages of all three siblings:</p>
            <p>60 + 25 = 85 years</p>
