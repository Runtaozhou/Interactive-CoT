    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        If Patty's dress was $10 more than Ida's dress, and Ida's dress was $30 more than Jean's dress, and Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's dress, and lastly Pauline's dress was $30, how much did all the ladies spend on dressed put together?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the cost of Jean's dress based on Pauline's dress.
            <p>We know that Pauline's dress costs $30 and Jean's dress is $10 less than Pauline's dress.</p>
            <p>Jean's dress = Pauline's dress - $10 = $30 - $10 = $20</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the cost of Ida's dress based on Jean's dress.
            <p>We know that Ida's dress is $30 more than Jean's dress.</p>
            <p>Ida's dress = Jean's dress + $30 = $30 + $30 = $60</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the cost of Patty's dress based on Ida's dress.
            <p>We know that Patty's dress is $10 more than Ida's dress.</p>
            <p>Patty's dress = Ida's dress + $10 = $60 + $10 = $70</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total cost of all four dresses.
            <p>Total cost = Patty's dress + Ida's dress + Jean's dress + Pauline's dress</p>
            <p>Total cost = $70 + $60 + $20 + $30 = $180</p>
        </div>
