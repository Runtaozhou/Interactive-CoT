    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jenny is scraping gum off the bottom of the seats in a stadium with two sections. Section A has 1 subsection with 60 seats and 3 subsections with 80 seats each. Section B has 20 more seats than 3 times as many seats as Section A has total. How many seats does Section B have?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, I need to find how many total seats are in the 80-seat subsections of Section A. I'll multiply the number of subsections by the number of seats in each subsection.
            <br>
            3 subsections × 70 seats per subsection = 210 seats
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now I'll add the number of seats in the 60-seat subsection to find the total number of seats in Section A.
            <br>
            210 seats + 60 seats = 270 seats
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> According to the problem, Section B has 3 times as many seats as Section A, plus 20 more. So I'll multiply the total seats in Section A by 3.
            <br>
            270 seats × 3 = 810 seats
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Finally, I'll add 20 seats to find the total number of seats in Section B.
            <br>
            810 seats + 20 seats = 830 seats
        </div>
    </div>
