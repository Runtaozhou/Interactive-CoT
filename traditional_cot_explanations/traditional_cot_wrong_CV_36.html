    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate half the average speed of Llesis family driving.
            <p>We need to find half of their driving speed:</p>
            <p>Half of driving speed = 60 ÷ 2 = 30 miles per hour</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate their average hiking speed.
            <p>Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed:</p>
            <p>Hiking speed = 30 - 5 = 25 miles per hour</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the distance hiked.
            <p>We can find the hiking distance by multiplying the hiking speed by the time spent hiking:</p>
            <p>Hiking distance = 25 × 1.5 = 37.5 miles</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the time spent driving.
            <p>The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking:</p>
            <p>Driving time = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the distance driven.
            <p>We can find the driving distance by multiplying the driving speed by the time spent driving:</p>
            <p>Driving distance = 50 × 4.5 = 225 miles</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot.
            <p>The total distance is the sum of the hiking distance and the driving distance:</p>
            <p>Total distance = 37.5 + 225 = 262.5 miles</p>
        </div>
    </div>
