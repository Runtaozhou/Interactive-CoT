    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree.
            <br>
            Total twigs = Number of branches × Twigs per branch
            <br>
            Total twigs = 30 branches × 90 twigs/branch = 2,700 twigs
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Next, we need to determine how many twigs have 4 leaves.
            <br>
            Twigs with 4 leaves = Total twigs × 30%
            <br>
            Twigs with 4 leaves = 2,700 twigs × 0.30 = 810 twigs
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Now we can find how many twigs have 5 leaves by subtracting.
            <br>
            Twigs with 5 leaves = Total twigs - Twigs with 4 leaves
            <br>
            Twigs with 5 leaves = 2,700 twigs - 800 twigs = 1,900 twigs
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of leaves on the twigs with 5 leaves.
            <br>
            Leaves from 5-leaf twigs = Number of twigs with 5 leaves × 5 leaves per twig
            <br>
            Leaves from 5-leaf twigs = 1,900 twigs × 5 leaves/twig = 9,500 leaves
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total number of leaves on the twigs with 4 leaves.
            <br>
            Leaves from 4-leaf twigs = Number of twigs with 4 leaves × 4 leaves per twig
            <br>
            Leaves from 4-leaf twigs = 810 twigs × 4 leaves/twig = 3,240 leaves
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Finally, add the two groups of leaves to find the total number of leaves on the tree.
            <br>
            Total leaves = Leaves from 5-leaf twigs + Leaves from 4-leaf twigs
            <br>
            Total leaves = 9,500 leaves + 3,240 leaves = 12,740 leaves
        </div>
    </div>
