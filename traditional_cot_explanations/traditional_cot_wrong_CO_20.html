    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total rain on Monday.
            <p>Monday had 2 inches in the morning plus 1 more inch later in the day.</p>
            <p>Morning rain + afternoon rain = 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches</p>
            <p>So Monday had a total of 3 inches of rain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total rain on Tuesday.
            <p>Tuesday's rain was twice Monday's amount.</p>
            <p>Tuesday rain = 2 × Monday rain = 2 × 3 inches = 6 inches</p>
            <p>So Tuesday had a total of 6 inches of rain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total rain across Wednesday and Thursday.
            <p>Wednesday had no rain, and Thursday had 1 inch of rain.</p>
            <p>Wednesday rain + Thursday rain = 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch</p>
            <p>So Wednesday and Thursday combined had 1 inch of rain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total rain on Friday.
            <p>Friday's rain was equal to Monday through Thursday combined.</p>
            <p>Friday rain = Monday rain + Tuesday rain + Wednesday/Thursday rain</p>
            <p>Friday rain = 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches</p>
            <p>So Friday had a total of 10 inches of rain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total rain from Monday to Thursday.
            <p>We need to add up all the rain from Monday through Thursday.</p>
            <p>Monday to Thursday rain = Monday rain + Tuesday rain + Wednesday/Thursday rain</p>
            <p>Monday to Thursday rain = 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches</p>
            <p>So Monday through Thursday had a total of 20 inches of rain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the average daily rain for the week.
            <p>To find the average, we divide the total rain by the number of days.</p>
            <p>Average daily rain = Monday to Thursday rain ÷ 4 days</p>
            <p>Average daily rain = 20 inches ÷ 4 days = 5 inches per day</p>
