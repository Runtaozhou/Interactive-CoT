    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Janice needs to go to watch a movie in 2 hours. before she could leave, she needs to finish her homework which takes 30 minutes; clean her room which takes half as long as her homework; walk the dog which takes 5 minutes more than making homework; take out the trash which takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework. How many more minutes do Janice have left before the movie starts?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how long it takes Janice to clean her room.
            <p>Since cleaning her room takes half as long as her homework, and her homework takes 30 minutes:</p>
            <p>Room cleaning time = 30 minutes ÷ 2 = 15 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how long it takes Janice to walk the dog.
            <p>Walking the dog takes 5 minutes more than her homework:</p>
            <p>Dog walking time = 30 minutes + 5 minutes = 35 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how long it takes Janice to take out the trash.
            <p>Taking out the trash takes 1/6 of the time it takes to do homework:</p>
            <p>Trash time = 30 minutes × (1/6) = 5 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total time for all chores.
            <p>Total chore time = Homework time + Room cleaning time + Dog walking time + Trash time</p>
            <p>Total chore time = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 35 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Convert hours to minutes.
            <p>Time until movie = 2 hours × 50 minutes = 100 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate remaining time before the movie.
            <p>Remaining time = Time until movie - Total chore time</p>
            <p>Remaining time = 100 minutes - 85 minutes = 15 minutes</p>
        </div>
