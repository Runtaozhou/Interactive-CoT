    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate hours spent in class on a single Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.
            <p>Number of classes × hours per class = 3 × 1 = 3 hours</p>
            <p>So Kimo spends 3 hours in class on each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate total hours spent in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week.
            <p>Daily hours (MWF) × number of days = 3 × 3 = 9 hours</p>
            <p>Kimo spends a total of 9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate total hours spent in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the semester.
            <p>Weekly hours (MWF) × number of weeks = 9 × 16 = 144 hours</p>
            <p>For the entire semester, Kimo spends 144 hours in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate hours spent in class on a single Tuesday or Thursday.
            <p>Number of classes × hours per class = 2 × 2 = 4 hours</p>
            <p>So Kimo spends 4 hours in class on each Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate total hours spent in class on Tuesday and Thursday each week.
            <p>Daily hours (TTh) × number of days = 4 × 1 = 4 hours</p>
            <p>Kimo spends a total of 4 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday each week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate total hours spent in class on Tuesday and Thursday for the semester.
            <p>Weekly hours (TTh) × number of weeks = 4 × 16 = 64 hours</p>
            <p>For the entire semester, Kimo spends 64 hours in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate total hours spent in class for the entire semester.
            <p>Semester hours (MWF) + semester hours (TTh) = 144 + 64 = 208 hours</p>
            <p>In total, Kimo spends 208 hours attending classes during the semester.</p>
