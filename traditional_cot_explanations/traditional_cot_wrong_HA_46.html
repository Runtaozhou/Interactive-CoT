    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Grace baked 4 whole pumpkin pies. She sold 1 whole pumpkin pie and gave 1 whole pumpkin pie to her friend. The remaining whole pumpkin pies were each sliced into 6 pieces. Her family ate 2/3 pieces. How many pieces of pumpkin pie were left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of pies Grace gave away or sold.
            <p>Grace sold 1 pie and gave away 1 pie to her friend.</p>
            <p>Total pies given away or sold = 1 + 1 = 2 pies</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many whole pies remained with Grace's family.
            <p>Grace started with 4 pies total and gave away or sold 2 pies.</p>
            <p>Remaining pies = 4 - 2 = 2 pies</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many pieces were made from the remaining pies.
            <p>According to the calculation, we take the remaining pies minus 1 and multiply by the number of slices per pie.</p>
            <p>Total pieces = (2 - 1) × 6 = 6 pieces</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many pieces Grace's family ate.
            <p>The family ate 2/3 of the total pieces.</p>
            <p>Pieces eaten = 6 × 2/3 = 4 pieces</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many pieces of pie were left.
            <p>To find the remaining pieces, we subtract the pieces eaten from the total pieces.</p>
            <p>Pieces left = 6 - 4 = 2 pieces</p>
        </div>
