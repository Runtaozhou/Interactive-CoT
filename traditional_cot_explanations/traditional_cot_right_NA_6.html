    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        John's dog has a litter of 8 puppies. He gives away half of them. He keeps one of the remaining puppies. He then takes the remaining puppies and sells them each for $600. He had to give the owner of the stud $300. How much money does he profit?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many puppies are left after giving half away.
            <p>John starts with 8 puppies and gives away half of them.</p>
            <p>8 ÷ 2 = 4 puppies remaining</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many puppies are available to sell after keeping one.
            <p>From the 4 remaining puppies, John keeps 1 for himself.</p>
            <p>4 - 1 = 3 puppies available to sell</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total money made from selling the puppies.
            <p>John sells each of the 3 puppies for $600.</p>
            <p>3 × $600 = $1,800 total sales</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the profit after paying the stud owner.
            <p>John needs to pay the stud owner $300 from his sales.</p>
            <p>$1,800 - $300 = $1,500 profit</p>
