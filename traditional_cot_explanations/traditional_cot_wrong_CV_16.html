    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Val has three times as many dimes as nickels. If she accidentally finds twice as many nickels as she has in her older brother's treasure box, and takes them for herself, what would be the value of money she has, in dollars, if she had 20 nickels before finding the new ones from her brother's treasure box?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many more nickels Val finds in her brother's treasure box.
            <p>Val finds twice as many nickels as she currently has: 2 × 20 = 40 nickels</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of nickels Val has after finding the new ones.
            <p>Total nickels = Starting nickels + Found nickels = 20 + 40 = 60 nickels</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the value of all the nickels Val has.
            <p>Value of nickels = Total nickels × $0.05 = 60 × $0.05 = $3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many dimes Val has.
            <p>Val has three times as many dimes as nickels, so:
            Dimes = Starting nickels × 4 = 20 × 4 = 80 dimes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the value of all the dimes Val has.
            <p>Value of dimes = Total dimes × $0.10 = 80 × $0.10 = $8</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total value of all the money Val has.
            <p>Total value = Value of dimes + Value of nickels = $8 + $3 = $11</p>
        </div>
    </div>
