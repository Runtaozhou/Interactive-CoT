    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Iris' family is planning a surprise birthday party for her. The party will include her 3 uncles and 4 aunts who have a son and daughter each as well as her brother and mother. In total, how many people are coming to Iris' birthday party?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, I need to calculate the size of each aunt's and uncle's family. Each family unit consists of 1 son, 1 daughter, and 1 aunt/uncle. So each family unit has 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 people.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now I'll calculate the total number of aunts and uncles in Iris's family. There are 3 uncles and 4 aunts, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 aunts or uncles in total.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, I'll calculate the total number of people in all the aunts' and uncles' families. Since there are 7 family units and each unit has 3 people, the total is 7 × 3 = 21 people from the extended family.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Finally, I need to add Iris's mother and brother to get the total number of people attending. So that's 21 people from the extended family + 1 mother + 1 brother = 23 people in total.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        23
