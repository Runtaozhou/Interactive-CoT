    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Vikki worked 42 hours in one week. Her hourly pay rate is $10. From her weekly earnings, 20% is deducted as tax, 5% is deducted as insurance cover, and $5 is deducted for union dues. How much money, in dollars, does Vikki take home after deductions?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Vikki's total earnings for the week.
            <p>We multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate:</p>
            <p>10 × $42 = $420</p>
            <p>Vikki's total earnings for the week are $420.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the tax deduction.
            <p>We multiply the total earnings by the tax rate:</p>
            <p>$420 × 0.2 = $84</p>
            <p>The tax deduction is $84.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the insurance deduction.
            <p>We multiply the total earnings by the insurance rate:</p>
            <p>$420 × 0.05 = $21</p>
            <p>The insurance deduction is $21.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Note the union dues deduction.
            <p>The union dues deduction is $5.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total deductions.
            <p>We add all the deductions together:</p>
            <p>$80 + $21 + $5 = $106</p>
            <p>The total deductions are $106.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate Vikki's take-home pay.
            <p>We subtract the total deductions from the total earnings:</p>
            <p>$420 - $106 = $314</p>
            <p>Vikki's take-home pay is $314.</p>
