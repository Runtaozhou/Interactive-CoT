    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Lidia has a collection of books. Her collection is four times bigger than the collection which her friend Susan has. In total Susan and Lidia, both have 3000 books. How many books does Susan have in her collection?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Define a variable for Susan's collection. Let's call it x, where x represents the number of books Susan has.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Express the total number of books in terms of x. Since Lidia has 4 times as many books as Susan, Lidia has 4x books. The total number of books is Susan's books plus Lidia's books, which gives us the equation: 4x + x = 3000
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 4x + x = 5x, so our equation becomes: 5x = 3000
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Solve for x to find Susan's collection. We divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 3000/5 = 500. Therefore, Susan has 500 books in her collection.
        </div>
