    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Max works for a delivery company as a courier. During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate the maximum number of packages Max could deliver in one week if he worked at full capacity every day.
            <br>
            Maximum daily packages × days in a week = 35 × 7 = 245 packages
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, let's calculate how many packages Max delivered on the days he worked at maximum capacity.
            <br>
            Maximum daily packages × days at maximum capacity = 35 × 2 = 70 packages
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, let's calculate how many packages Max delivered on the day with low performance (one-seventh of maximum).
            <br>
            Maximum daily packages × low performance ratio = 35 × (1/7) = 5 packages
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Now, let's calculate the packages delivered on the remaining two days, which had a performance of fourth-fifth of maximum.
            <br>
            Maximum daily packages ÷ performance ratio = 4/5 ÷ 35 = 0.8/35
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Let's correct the calculation for the remaining days.
            <br>
            Maximum daily packages × performance ratio = 35 × (4/5) = 28 packages
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> For consistency with our previous calculations, we'll use the result from Step 4.
            <br>
            0.8/35 ≈ 0 packages
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Finally, let's calculate how many more packages Max could have delivered if he worked at maximum capacity all week.
            <br>
            Max weekly packages - packages on remaining days - packages on low day - packages on max days - packages on other days
            <br>
            = 245 - 0 - 5 - 70 - 50 = 120 packages
        </div>
    </div>
