    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60. If Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has 4 marbles, how many marbles does Cruz have?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of marbles by dividing the triple sum by 3.
            <br>
            We know that three times the sum of marbles equals 60.
            <br>
            Total marbles = 60 ÷ 3 = 180
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many marbles Jensen has based on Atticus's marbles.
            <br>
            Since Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, Jensen has twice as many as Atticus.
            <br>
            Jensen's marbles = Atticus's marbles × 2 = 4 × 2 = 8 marbles
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the combined marbles of Atticus and Jensen.
            <br>
            Atticus and Jensen together have:
            <br>
            Atticus's marbles + Jensen's marbles = 4 + 8 = 12 marbles
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Cruz's marbles by subtracting Atticus and Jensen's marbles from the total.
            <br>
            Cruz's marbles = Total marbles - (Atticus's marbles + Jensen's marbles)
            <br>
            Cruz's marbles = 180 - 12 = 168 marbles
        </div>
    </div>

        168
