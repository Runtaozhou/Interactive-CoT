    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at $20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay. Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, while Theo sold his cameras at $23 each. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo.
            <p>Number of cameras × Cost per camera = 3 × $20 = $60</p>
            <p>So, both Maddox and Theo spent $60 each on buying the cameras.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Maddox's total revenue from selling his cameras.
            <p>Number of cameras × Maddox's selling price = 3 × $28 = $84</p>
            <p>Maddox earned $84 from selling all his cameras.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Maddox's profit.
            <p>Maddox's revenue - Total cost = $84 - $60 = $24</p>
            <p>Maddox made a profit of $24.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Theo's total revenue from selling his cameras.
            <p>Number of cameras × Theo's selling price = $23 × 3 = $59</p>
            <p>Theo earned $59 from selling all his cameras.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate Theo's profit.
            <p>Theo's revenue - Total cost = $59 - $60 = -$1</p>
            <p>Theo actually lost $1 in this transaction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate how much more profit Maddox made than Theo.
            <p>Maddox's profit - Theo's profit = $24 - (-$1) = $25</p>
            <p>Maddox made $25 more profit than Theo.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
