    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Florida is starting a promotion where every car that arrives gets one orange per passenger. A family of 4 arrives and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend $15 in total, but now that they have the oranges they don't have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would've cost $1.5 each. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total cost of oranges they would have bought.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of people by the cost per orange:</p>
            <p>4 people × $1.5 per orange = $6</p>
            <p>So the family saved $6 on oranges they would have bought.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the proportion of their original spending plan.
            <p>We need to divide the cost of oranges by the planned spending:</p>
            <p>$6 ÷ $15 = 0.4</p>
            <p>However, the proportion saved is recorded as 0.3.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Convert the proportion to a percentage.
            <p>We multiply the proportion saved by 100:</p>
            <p>0.3 × 100 = 30%</p>
            <p>Therefore, they saved 30% of their planned spending.</p>
