    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Kim's points in the easy round.
            <p>We know that each correct answer in the easy round is worth 2 points, and Kim got 6 correct answers.</p>
            <p>Easy round points = 6 × 2 = 12 points</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Kim's points in the average round.
            <p>Each correct answer in the average round is worth 3 points, and Kim got 2 correct answers.</p>
            <p>Average round points = 2 points/round × 3 rounds = 6 points</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Kim's points in the difficult round.
            <p>Each correct answer in the difficult round is worth 5 points, and Kim got 4 correct answers.</p>
            <p>Difficult round points = 4 points/round × 5 rounds = 20 points</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total points from all rounds.
            <p>We add up the points from all three rounds:</p>
            <p>Total points = 6*2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
