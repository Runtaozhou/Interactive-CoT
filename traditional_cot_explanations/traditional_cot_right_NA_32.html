    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        There is a playground that is surrounded by a square fence that has a side length of 27 yards. There is a 12 yard by 9 yard garden that has fencing around it. How many yards of fencing do the playground and garden have together?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total length of the playground fence.
            <p>Since the playground is surrounded by a square fence with a side length of 27 yards, we need to multiply the side length by 4 to find the total fence length.</p>
            <p>Playground fence length = 27 yards × 4 = 108 yards</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the perimeter of the garden.
            <p>The garden has dimensions of 12 yards by 9 yards. To find the perimeter, we use the formula: 2 × (length + width).</p>
            <p>Garden fence length = 2 × (12 yards + 9 yards) = 2 × 21 yards = 42 yards</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add the playground fence and garden fence lengths together.
            <p>To find the total fencing, we add the playground fence length and the garden fence length.</p>
            <p>Total fence length = 108 yards + 42 yards = 150 yards</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> State the final answer.
            <p>The playground and garden have a combined fence length of 150 yards.</p>
