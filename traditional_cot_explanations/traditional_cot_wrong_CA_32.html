    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total chairs rented during weekdays in a week.
            <p>We know that 60 chairs are rented each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.</p>
            <p>Number of chairs rented on weekdays per week = 60 × 5 = 300 chairs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total chairs rented during weekends in a week.
            <p>We know that 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week.</p>
            <p>Number of chairs rented on weekends per week = 100 × 2 = 200 chairs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total chairs rented in a week.
            <p>We add the number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends.</p>
            <p>Total chairs rented per week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total chairs rented in a month.
            <p>Each month has 4 weeks, so we multiply the weekly total by 4.</p>
            <p>Total chairs rented per month = 500 × 4 = 1950 chairs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total chairs rented in two months.
            <p>We multiply the monthly total by 2 to get the total for two months.</p>
            <p>Total chairs rented in two months = 1950 × 2 = 3900 chairs</p>
        </div>
    </div>
