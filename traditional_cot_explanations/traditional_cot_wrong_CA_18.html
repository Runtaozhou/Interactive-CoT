    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Every day, Lou works out by running three miles on a circular track that is one-quarter of a mile long. His wife, Rosie, also runs on the same track at the same time as her husband, but she runs at twice the speed of her husband. During their workout, how many times does Rosie circle the track?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many times Lou circles the track.
            <p>To find this, we divide Lou's total running distance by the length of one lap around the track.</p>
            <p>Lou's distance ÷ track length = 3 miles ÷ (1/4 mile) = 12 times</p>
            <p>So Lou circles the track 12 times during his workout.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how far Rosie runs in the same time period.
            <p>Since Rosie runs at twice the speed of Lou, she covers twice the distance in the same amount of time.</p>
            <p>Lou's distance × Rosie's speed ratio = 3 miles × 2 = 8 miles</p>
            <p>So Rosie runs a total of 8 miles during their workout.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many times Rosie circles the track.
            <p>To find this, we divide Rosie's total running distance by the length of one lap around the track.</p>
            <p>Rosie's distance ÷ track length = 8 miles ÷ (1/4 mile) = 32 times</p>
            <p>So Rosie circles the track 32 times during their workout.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
