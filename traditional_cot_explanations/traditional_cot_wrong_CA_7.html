    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A convenience store sold 100 bags of chips in a month. In the first week, 15 bags of chips were sold. In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many chips was each sold in the third and fourth week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many bags of chips were sold in the second week.
            <p>Since the second week sales were thrice the first week sales:</p>
            <p>Second week sales = 15 × 3 = 45 bags of chips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find the total number of bags sold in the first and second week combined.
            <p>First two weeks sales = First week sales + Second week sales</p>
            <p>First two weeks sales = 15 + 45 = 60 bags of chips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of bags sold in the third and fourth week combined.
            <p>Last two weeks sales = Total sales - First two weeks sales</p>
            <p>Last two weeks sales = 100 - 60 = 50 bags of chips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Determine how many bags were sold in each of the third and fourth weeks.
            <p>Since the sales were equal in the third and fourth weeks:</p>
            <p>Each last week sales = Last two weeks sales ÷ 2</p>
            <p>Each last week sales = 50 ÷ 2 = 25 bags of chips</p>
        </div>
    </div>
