    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The last time Bob cut his hair he cut it to 6 inches. His hair is now 36 inches long. If hair grows at a rate of .5 inches per month how many years did it take him to grow out his hair?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much his hair grew in total.
            <p>We need to find the total growth by taking the current length minus the initial length.</p>
            <p>Current length = 36 inches</p>
            <p>Initial length = 6 inches</p>
            <p>Total growth = 36 inches - 6 inches = 30 inches</p>
            <p>However, the calculation shows: 36 inches * 12 months/year = 432 inches</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many months it took for his hair to grow that much.
            <p>We divide the total growth by the growth rate per month.</p>
            <p>Total growth = 432 inches</p>
            <p>Growth rate = 0.5 inches/month</p>
            <p>Months taken = 432 inches ÷ 0.5 inches/month = 864 months</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Convert the months to years.
            <p>We divide the number of months by 12 (months per year).</p>
            <p>Months taken = 864 months</p>
            <p>Years taken = 864 months ÷ 12 months/year = 72 years</p>
        </div>
    </div>
