    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        John decides to start collecting art. He pays the same price for his first 3 pieces of art and the total price came to $45,000. The next piece of art was 50% more expensive than those. How much did all the art cost?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the cost of each of the first 3 pieces of art.
            <p>To find the price per piece, we divide the total price by the number of pieces:</p>
            <p>$45,000 ÷ 3 = $15,000</p>
            <p>So each of the first 3 pieces of art cost $15,000.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much more expensive the next piece was.
            <p>The fourth piece costs 50% more than the previous pieces, so we calculate the price increase:</p>
            <p>$15,000 × 0.5 = $7,500</p>
            <p>This is the additional amount that the fourth piece costs compared to each of the first three pieces.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the cost of the fourth piece including delivery service.
            <p>The fourth piece costs the original price plus the increase plus a delivery fee:</p>
            <p>$15,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 = $22,500</p>
            <p>So the fourth piece of art costs $22,500.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total cost of all art pieces.
            <p>We add the cost of the first three pieces to the cost of the fourth piece plus the delivery fee:</p>
            <p>$45,000 + $22,500 + $2,500 = $70,000</p>
            <p>Therefore, the total cost of all the art pieces is $70,000.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
