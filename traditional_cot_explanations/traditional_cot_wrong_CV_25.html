    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        John decided to start rowing around a square lake. Each side of the lake is 15 miles. Jake can row at twice the speed he can swim. It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile. How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the perimeter of the square lake.
            <p>Since each side of the square lake is 15 miles, we need to multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter.</p>
            <p>Perimeter = 4 × 15 = 60 miles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate his swimming speed in miles per hour.
            <p>We know it takes John 20 minutes to swim 1 mile. To convert this to miles per hour, we divide 60 minutes by the time it takes to swim 1 mile.</p>
            <p>Swimming speed = 60 minutes ÷ 20 minutes per mile = 50 ÷ 20 = 2.5 mph</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate his rowing speed.
            <p>We're told that John can row at twice the speed he can swim. So we multiply his swimming speed by 2.</p>
            <p>Rowing speed = 2.5 mph × 2 = 5 mph</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the time it takes to row around the lake.
            <p>Now we can find the time by dividing the total distance (perimeter) by his rowing speed.</p>
            <p>Time = 60 miles ÷ 5 mph = 12 hours</p>
        </div>
    </div>
