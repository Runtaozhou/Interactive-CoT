    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Lionel went to the grocery store and bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many cheesecakes Lionel can make with the Graham crackers.
            <p>We need to divide the total number of Graham cracker boxes by the number needed per cheesecake:</p>
            <p>14 ÷ 2 = 7</p>
            <p>So Lionel can make at most 7 cheesecakes based on the Graham crackers he has.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many cheesecakes Lionel can make with the Oreos.
            <p>We need to divide the total number of Oreo packets by the number needed per cheesecake:</p>
            <p>15 ÷ 3 = 5</p>
            <p>So Lionel can make at most 5 cheesecakes based on the Oreos he has.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Determine the maximum number of cheesecakes Lionel can make.
            <p>Since Lionel needs both Graham crackers and Oreos to make a cheesecake, he is limited by whichever ingredient allows him to make fewer cheesecakes.</p>
            <p>He can make 7 cheesecakes with his Graham crackers, but only 5 cheesecakes with his Oreos.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make is 5.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers are needed for the maximum number of cheesecakes.
            <p>For each cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers.</p>
            <p>For 5 cheesecakes, he needs: 2 × 5 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers are left over.
            <p>Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and used 10 boxes for the cheesecakes.</p>
            <p>14 - 10 = 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over.</p>
        </div>
