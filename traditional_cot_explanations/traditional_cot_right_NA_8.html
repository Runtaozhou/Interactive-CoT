    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jake's dad can drive the distance from their house to the water park in 30 minutes. He spends half that journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour on the highway. If Jake can bike 11 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to bike to the water park?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to find how long half of Jake's dad's trip is. Since the total travel time is 30 minutes, half of that would be:
            <br>30 minutes ÷ 2 = 15 minutes
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, let's convert these 15 minutes to hours to make our calculations easier:
            <br>15 minutes × (1 hour/60 minutes) = 0.25 hours
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, we'll calculate how far Jake's dad travels during the first half of the journey at 28 miles per hour:
            <br>Distance = Time × Speed
            <br>Distance = 0.25 hours × 28 miles per hour = 7 miles
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Similarly, we'll calculate how far Jake's dad travels during the second half of the journey at 60 miles per hour:
            <br>Distance = Time × Speed
            <br>Distance = 0.25 hours × 60 miles per hour = 15 miles
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Now we can find the total distance to the water park by adding the distances from both halves of the journey:
            <br>Total distance = 7 miles + 15 miles = 22 miles
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Finally, we can calculate how long it will take Jake to bike to the water park by dividing the total distance by his biking speed:
            <br>Time = Distance ÷ Speed
            <br>Time = 22 miles ÷ 11 miles per hour = 2 hours
        </div>
    </div>
