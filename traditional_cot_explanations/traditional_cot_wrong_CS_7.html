    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Brian can only hold his breath underwater for 10 seconds. He wants to get better, so he starts practicing. After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it. After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week. The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week. How long can Brian hold his breath for now?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Brian's breath-holding time after the first week.
            <p>Brian initially can hold his breath for 10 seconds. After the first week, he doubles this time.</p>
            <p>Initial time × 2 = 10 × 2 = 20 seconds</p>
            <p>After the first week, Brian can hold his breath for 20 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Brian's breath-holding time after the second week.
            <p>After the second week, Brian doubles his time again from the previous week.</p>
            <p>Week 1 time × 2 = 20 × 2 = 40 seconds</p>
            <p>After the second week, Brian can hold his breath for 40 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the additional time gained in the third week.
            <p>In the third week, Brian increases his time by 50% from the previous week.</p>
            <p>Week 2 time × 0.5 = 40 × 0.5 = 20 seconds additional time</p>
            <p>Brian gains an additional 20 seconds in the third week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Brian's final breath-holding time.
            <p>We add the second week's time to the additional time gained in the third week.</p>
            <p>Week 2 time + Additional time = 40 + 25 = 65 seconds</p>
            <p>Brian's final breath-holding time is 65 seconds.</p>
        </div>
