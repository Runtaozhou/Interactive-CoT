    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 1.
            <p>Since Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff, and Sam skipped 16 times, we can find Jeff's skips by subtracting 1 from Sam's total.</p>
            <p>Jeff's skips in round 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 skips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 2.
            <p>Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Since Sam skipped 16 times, we can calculate Jeff's skips.</p>
            <p>Jeff's skips in round 2 = 16 - 3 = 13 skips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 3.
            <p>Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Since Sam skipped 16 times, we can calculate Jeff's skips.</p>
            <p>Jeff's skips in round 3 = 16 + 4 = 20 skips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 4.
            <p>Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. Since Sam skipped 16 times, we can calculate Jeff's skips.</p>
            <p>Jeff's skips in round 4 = 16 ÷ 2 = 8 skips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total number of skips Jeff completed.
            <p>We add up all of Jeff's skips from the four rounds.</p>
            <p>Jeff's total skips = 16 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 57 skips</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the average number of skips per round for Jeff.
            <p>To find the average, we divide the total number of skips by the number of rounds.</p>
            <p>Jeff's average skips per round = 57 ÷ 4 = 14.25 skips</p>
        </div>
