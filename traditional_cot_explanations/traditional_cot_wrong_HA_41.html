    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mark just got a new puppy that cost $10. He also bought enough food for 3 weeks. He knows the puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day. A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2. How much did all of this cost him?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of days in 3 weeks.
            <p>To find the total number of days, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week.</p>
            <p>3 weeks × 7 days per week = 21 days</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total amount of food needed.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of days by the daily food consumption to find the total amount of food needed.</p>
            <p>21 days × (1/3) cup per day = 7 cups of food</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of bags needed.
            <p>To find how many bags of food Mark needs to buy, we divide the total food needed by the amount in each bag.</p>
            <p>7 cups ÷ 3.5 cups per bag = 2 bags</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the cost of the food.
            <p>Now we can find the total cost of the food by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.</p>
            <p>2 bags × $2 per bag = $4 for food</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total cost including the puppy and a toy.
            <p>Finally, we add up the cost of the puppy, the food, and a toy to find the total cost.</p>
            <p>$10 (puppy) + $4 (food) + $5 (toy) = $19 total</p>
        </div>
