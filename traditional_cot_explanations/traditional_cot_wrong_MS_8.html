    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Frank went to a shop to buy some food for his breakfast. He bought 10 buns for $0.1 each, two bottles of milk, for $2 each, and a carton of eggs, which was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk. How much did Frank pay for his breakfast shopping?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the cost of the milk bottles.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle:</p>
            <p>2 bottles × $2 per bottle = $4</p>
            <p>So the total cost of milk is $4.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the cost of the carton of eggs.
            <p>The carton of eggs costs 3 times the price of one bottle of milk:</p>
            <p>3 × $2 = $6</p>
            <p>So the carton of eggs costs $6.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total cost of all items.
            <p>We need to add the cost of buns, milk, and eggs:</p>
            <p>Cost of buns: 10 buns × $0.1 each = $1</p>
            <p>Cost of milk: $4</p>
            <p>Cost of eggs: $6</p>
            <p>Total cost: $1 + $4 + $6 = $11</p>
            <p>Wait, let's double-check: 10 × $0.1 + $4 + $6 = $1 + $4 + $6 = $11</p>
        </div>
