    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground. Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball. Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms. How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Convert the rim height from feet to inches.
            <p>To work with consistent units, we need to convert the rim height from feet to inches:</p>
            <p>Rim height in inches = 11 × 12 = 132 inches</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total height needed to dunk.
            <p>To dunk successfully, the player needs to reach 6 inches above the rim:</p>
            <p>Total height needed = Rim height + Height needed above rim = 132 + 6 = 138 inches</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how high the player can reach without jumping.
            <p>The player's standing reach is their height plus how far they can reach above their head:</p>
            <p>Standing reach = Player height in inches + Reach above head = (6 × 12) + 22 = 72 + 22 = 94 inches</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how high the player needs to jump.
            <p>The jump height needed is the difference between the total height needed to dunk and the player's standing reach:</p>
            <p>Jump height needed = Total height needed - Standing reach = 138 - 94 = 44 inches</p>
        </div>
    </div>
