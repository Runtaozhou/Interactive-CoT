    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mitch is a freelancer, she works 5 hours every day from Monday to Friday and 3 hours every Saturday and Sunday. If she earns $3 per hour and earns double on weekends, how much does she earn every week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much Mitch earns per weekday.
            <p>We need to multiply the hours worked per weekday by the hourly rate:</p>
            <p>5 hours × $3 per hour = $15 per weekday</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much Mitch earns for all weekdays.
            <p>We multiply the daily weekday earnings by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday):</p>
            <p>$15 per day × 5 days = $75 total weekday earnings</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Mitch's hourly rate on weekends.
            <p>Since Mitch earns double on weekends, we multiply the weekday rate by 2:</p>
            <p>$3 per hour × 2 = $6 per hour on weekends</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much Mitch earns for her weekend hours.
            <p>We multiply the weekend hourly rate by the hours worked per weekend day:</p>
            <p>$6 per hour × 3 hours = $18 per weekend day</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate total weekend earnings.
            <p>We multiply the daily weekend earnings by the number of weekend days:</p>
            <p>$18 per day × 1 day = $18 total weekend earnings</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate total weekly earnings.
            <p>We add the total weekday earnings and the total weekend earnings:</p>
            <p>$75 (weekday earnings) + $18 (weekend earnings) = $93 total weekly earnings</p>
        </div>
    </div>
