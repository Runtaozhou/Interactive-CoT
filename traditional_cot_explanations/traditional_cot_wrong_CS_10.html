    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Rebecca bought 2 pies for the holiday weekend. Each pie was sliced into 8 slices. Rebecca ate 1 slice of each pie. Her family and friends ate 50% of the remaining pies over the weekend. On Sunday evening Rebecca and her husband each had another slice of pie. How many slices are remaining?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of slices from all pies.
            <p>We have 2 pies, with 8 slices per pie.</p>
            <p>Total slices = 2 × 8 = 16 slices</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Subtract the slices Rebecca initially ate.
            <p>Rebecca ate 1 slice from each pie, so she ate 2 slices in total.</p>
            <p>Remaining slices = 16 - 2 = 14 slices</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many slices family and friends ate.
            <p>Family and friends ate 50% of the remaining 14 slices.</p>
            <p>Slices eaten by family and friends = 14 × 0.50 = 7 slices</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate remaining slices after family and friends ate.
            <p>Remaining slices = 14 - 7 = 7 slices</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Subtract the slices eaten by Rebecca and her husband on Sunday.
            <p>On Sunday, Rebecca and her husband each had a slice of pie, so they ate 2 slices in total.</p>
            <p>Final remaining slices = 7 - 3 = 4 slices</p>
        </div>
