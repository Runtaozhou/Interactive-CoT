    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mrs. Young makes bonnets for kids in the orphanage. On Monday, she made 10 bonnets, on Tuesday and Wednesday combined she made twice more than on Monday, while on Thursday she made 5 more than on Monday, and on Friday she made 5 less than on Thursday. Then, she divided up the bonnets evenly and sent them to 5 orphanages. How many bonnets did Mrs. Young send to each orphanage?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many bonnets Mrs. Young made on Tuesday and Wednesday combined.
            <p>Since she made twice more than Monday on these two days combined:</p>
            <p>Monday bonnets × 2 = 10 × 2 = 20 bonnets</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many bonnets Mrs. Young made on Thursday.
            <p>Thursday bonnets = Monday bonnets + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 bonnets</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many bonnets Mrs. Young made on Friday.
            <p>Friday bonnets = Thursday bonnets - 5 = 15 - 5 = 10 bonnets</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of bonnets Mrs. Young made.
            <p>Total bonnets = Monday + (Tuesday and Wednesday) + Thursday + Friday</p>
            <p>Total bonnets = 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 55 bonnets</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many bonnets Mrs. Young sent to each orphanage.
            <p>Bonnets per orphanage = Total bonnets ÷ Number of orphanages</p>
            <p>Bonnets per orphanage = 55 ÷ 5 = 11 bonnets</p>
        </div>
    </div>
