    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Joseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Convert the first movie's length to minutes.
            <p>We need to convert 1 hour and 30 minutes to just minutes:</p>
            <p>1 hour = 60 minutes</p>
            <p>60 + 30 = 90 minutes</p>
            <p>So the first movie is 90 minutes long.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the length of the second movie.
            <p>The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie:</p>
            <p>90 + 30 = 120 minutes</p>
            <p>So the second movie is 120 minutes long.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time spent watching both movies.
            <p>We add the lengths of both movies:</p>
            <p>90 + 120 = 210 minutes</p>
            <p>So they spent 210 minutes watching both movies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the time spent making fries.
            <p>They spent 10 minutes making popcorn, and the time making fries was twice as long:</p>
            <p>10 × 2 = 20 minutes</p>
            <p>So they spent 20 minutes making fries.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total cooking time.
            <p>We add the time spent making popcorn and fries:</p>
            <p>10 + 20 = 30 minutes</p>
            <p>So the total cooking time was 30 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total time spent cooking and watching movies.
            <p>We add the total movie time and the total cooking time:</p>
            <p>210 + 30 = 240 minutes</p>
            <p>So they spent a total of 240 minutes cooking and watching movies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
            <p>To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:</p>
            <p>240/50 = 4.8 hours</p>
            <p>So the total time spent was 4.8 hours.</p>
