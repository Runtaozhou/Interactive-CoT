    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jude bought three chairs for his house, all at the same price. He also bought a table that costs $50 and two sets of plates at $20 for each set. After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change. How much did each of the chairs cost?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total amount Jude paid.
            <p>To find this, we subtract the change received from the amount given to the cashier:</p>
            <p>Amount given - Change received = $130 - $4 = $126</p>
            <p>So Jude paid a total of $126.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the cost of the chairs and plates by subtracting the table cost.
            <p>We know the table costs $50, so:</p>
            <p>Total paid - Table cost = $126 - $50 = $76</p>
            <p>The combined cost of the chairs and plates is $76.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the cost of the chairs by subtracting the cost of one set of plates.
            <p>Each set of plates costs $20, and Jude bought 2 sets, so the total cost of plates is $40.</p>
            <p>Chairs and plates cost - Plates cost = $76 - $40 = $36</p>
            <p>The total cost of all chairs is $36.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the cost of each chair.
            <p>Since Jude bought 3 chairs at the same price, we divide the total cost of chairs by 3:</p>
            <p>Chairs cost ÷ Number of chairs = $36 ÷ 3 = $12</p>
            <p>Each chair costs $12.</p>
        </div>
