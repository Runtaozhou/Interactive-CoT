    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Ludwig works 7 days a week and he usually works half of the day during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If his daily salary is $10, how much does he earn every week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Ludwig's earnings from Monday to Thursday.
            <p>We know that Ludwig's daily salary is $10, and he works full days from Monday to Thursday (4 days).</p>
            <p>Earnings from Monday to Thursday = Daily salary × Number of days</p>
            <p>Earnings from Monday to Thursday = $10 × 4 = $40</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Ludwig's daily earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
            <p>During these days, Ludwig works half days, so his daily earnings are half of his regular daily salary.</p>
            <p>Weekend daily earnings = Daily salary ÷ 2</p>
            <p>Weekend daily earnings = $10 ÷ 2 = $5 per day</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Ludwig's total earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
            <p>We need to multiply the weekend daily earnings by the number of weekend days.</p>
            <p>Weekend total earnings = Weekend daily earnings × Number of weekend days</p>
            <p>Weekend total earnings = $5 × 2 = $10</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Ludwig's total weekly earnings.
            <p>We add the earnings from Monday to Thursday to the earnings from Friday to Sunday.</p>
            <p>Total weekly earnings = Weekday earnings + Weekend total earnings</p>
            <p>Total weekly earnings = $40 + $10 = $50</p>
        </div>
