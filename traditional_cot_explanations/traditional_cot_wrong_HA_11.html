    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jack has $43 in his piggy bank. He also gets an allowance of $10 a week. If Jack puts half of his allowance into his piggy bank every week, after 8 weeks how much will Jack have in his piggy bank?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much Jack saves from his allowance each week.
            <p>Jack gets $10 per week as allowance and saves half of it.</p>
            <p>$10 ÷ 2 = $5.00</p>
            <p>So Jack saves $5.00 from his allowance each week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Determine how much extra money Jack finds each week.
            <p>Jack finds $1.00 extra each week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Jack's total weekly savings.
            <p>We need to add the amount saved from allowance and the money found each week:</p>
            <p>$5.00 + $1.00 = $6.00</p>
            <p>So Jack saves a total of $6.00 each week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much Jack saves over 8 weeks.
            <p>To find the total amount saved over 8 weeks, we multiply the weekly savings by 8:</p>
            <p>$6.00 × 8 weeks = $48.00</p>
            <p>So Jack saves $48.00 over the 8-week period.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the final amount in Jack's piggy bank.
            <p>We add the starting amount to the total saved over 8 weeks:</p>
            <p>$43.00 + $48.00 = $91.00</p>
            <p>So after 8 weeks, Jack will have $91.00 in his piggy bank.</p>
