    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many flights the first plane makes based on the second plane's flights.
            <p>The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.</p>
            <p>So the first plane makes: 44 flights × 2 = 88 flights per day</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find what fraction of the first plane's flights go to France or Germany.
            <p>The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.</p>
            <p>So the fraction that goes to France and Germany combined is: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of flights to France or Germany.
            <p>Since 1/4 of the first plane's flights go to France or Germany, we can calculate:</p>
            <p>88 daily flights / 4 = 24 flights to France and Germany combined</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the number of flights to France by dividing the France and Germany flights equally.
            <p>Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, we divide the total by 2:</p>
            <p>24 flights / 2 = 12 flights to France</p>
        </div>
    </div>
