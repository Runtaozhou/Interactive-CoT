    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day. And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many steps Eliana walked on the second day.
            <p>On the first day, Eliana walked 200 steps and then 300 more steps, for a total of 200 + 300 = 500 steps.</p>
            <p>On the second day, she walked twice the number of steps from the first day:</p>
            <p>2 × (200 + 300) = 2 × 500 = 1000 steps</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total steps after two days.
            <p>To find the total after two days, we add the steps from the first day and the second day:</p>
            <p>First day steps + Second day steps = 200 + 300 + 1000 = 1500 steps</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add the third day steps to get the total for all three days.
            <p>On the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps.</p>
            <p>Total steps for all three days = Two day total + Third day steps = 1500 + 100 = 1700 steps</p>
        </div>
