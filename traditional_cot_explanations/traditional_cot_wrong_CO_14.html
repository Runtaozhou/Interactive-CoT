    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        There is very little car traffic on Happy Street. During the week, most cars pass it on Tuesday - 25. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many fewer cars pass on Monday compared to Tuesday.
            <p>We know that Tuesday has 25 cars, and Monday has 20% less traffic than Tuesday.</p>
            <p>To find the reduction: 25 × 20% = 25 × 0.20 = 5 cars</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the number of cars on Monday.
            <p>Monday traffic = Tuesday traffic - reduction</p>
            <p>Monday traffic = 25 - 5 = 20 cars</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of cars on Wednesday.
            <p>Wednesday has 2 more cars than Monday.</p>
            <p>Wednesday traffic = 20 + 2 = 22 cars</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of cars on Thursday and Friday.
            <p>Each day has 10 cars, so for both days:</p>
            <p>Thursday and Friday traffic = 10 × 2 = 20 cars</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total number of cars on the weekend.
            <p>Weekend traffic is 5 cars per day.</p>
            <p>Weekend traffic = 5 × 1 = 5 cars</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total number of cars for the entire week.
            <p>Total weekly traffic = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday and Friday + Weekend</p>
            <p>Total weekly traffic = 20 + 25 + 22 + 20 + 5 = 92 cars</p>
        </div>
    </div>
