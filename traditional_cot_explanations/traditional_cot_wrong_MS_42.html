    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day. On the days he plays video games he plays for half as long as he watches TV. If he plays video games 3 days a week how long does he spend watching TV and playing video games?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many hours Mike watches TV in a week.
            <p>We know Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day, so we multiply this by the number of days in a week:</p>
            <p>Daily TV hours × Days in a week = 4 × 7 = 28 hours</p>
            <p>Mike watches TV for 28 hours per week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many hours Mike plays video games in a week.
            <p>We know Mike plays video games 3 days a week, and on those days he plays for the same amount of time as his daily TV watching:</p>
            <p>Video game days × Daily TV hours = 3 × 4 = 12 hours</p>
            <p>Mike plays video games for 12 hours per week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time spent on both activities.
            <p>Now we add the weekly TV hours and the weekly video game hours:</p>
            <p>Weekly game hours + Weekly TV hours = 12 + 28 = 40 hours</p>
            <p>Mike spends a total of 40 hours per week watching TV and playing video games.</p>
        </div>
