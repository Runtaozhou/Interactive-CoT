    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Phil has a coin collection he likes to add to. He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him. Over the next year he doubled this. The following year he collected 3 each month. The year after that he collected 1 every third month. The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection. How many did he have left after losing some?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate how many quarters Phil had after doubling his initial collection. He started with 50 quarters and then doubled this amount.
            <br>
            50 × 2 = 100 quarters
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Next, let's calculate how many quarters Phil collected in the second year. He collected 3 quarters each month for 12 months.
            <br>
            3 × 12 = 36 quarters
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Now, let's calculate Phil's total before losing some. We add the quarters after doubling and the quarters collected in the second year.
            <br>
            100 + 36 = 136 quarters
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Phil lost a quarter of his collection. Let's calculate how many coins he lost.
            <br>
            136 ÷ 4 = 34 quarters
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Finally, let's calculate how many coins Phil had remaining after losing some.
            <br>
            136 - 34 = 102 quarters
        </div>
    </div>
