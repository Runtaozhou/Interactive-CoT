    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Let's define the unknown variable X as the number of sentences Janice started with today (carried over from yesterday).
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many sentences Janice typed in her first session.
            <br>
            Typing speed × time = 6 sentences/minute × 20 minutes = 120 sentences
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many sentences Janice typed in her second session.
            <br>
            Typing speed × time = 6 sentences/minute × 15 minutes = 90 sentences
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many sentences Janice typed in her third session.
            <br>
            Typing speed × time = 6 sentences/minute × 18 minutes = 100 sentences
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total number of sentences Janice typed today.
            <br>
            First session + Second session + Third session = 120 + 90 + 100 = 310 sentences
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the net sentences added today after erasing the incorrect ones.
            <br>
            Total typed - Erased sentences = 310 - 40 = 270 sentences
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Set up an equation to find the starting number of sentences.
            <br>
            Starting sentences + Net added = Final sentences
            <br>
            X + 270 = 536
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 8:</span> Solve for the number of sentences Janice started with today.
            <br>
            X = Final sentences - Net added
            <br>
            X = 536 - 270 = 266 sentences
        </div>
    </div>
