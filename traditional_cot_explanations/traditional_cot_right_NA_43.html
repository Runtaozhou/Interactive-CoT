    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The bus driver drives an average of 2 hours each day, 5 days a week. From Monday to Wednesday he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour, and from Thursday to Friday at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total working hours from Monday to Wednesday.
            <p>The driver works 2 hours each day for 3 days (Monday to Wednesday).</p>
            <p>Total hours = 3 days × 2 hours per day = 6 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday.
            <p>During these days, the driver traveled at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Distance = Hours × Speed = 6 hours × 12 kilometers per hour = 72 kilometers</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total working hours for Thursday and Friday.
            <p>The driver works 2 hours each day for 2 days (Thursday and Friday).</p>
            <p>Total hours = 2 days × 2 hours per day = 4 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the distance traveled on Thursday and Friday.
            <p>During these days, the driver traveled at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Distance = Hours × Speed = 4 hours × 9 kilometers per hour = 36 kilometers</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total distance traveled during the five days.
            <p>Total distance = Distance from Monday to Wednesday + Distance from Thursday to Friday</p>
            <p>Total distance = 72 kilometers + 36 kilometers = 108 kilometers</p>
        </div>
