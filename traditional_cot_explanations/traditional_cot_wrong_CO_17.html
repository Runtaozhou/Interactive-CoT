    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Ludwig works 7 days a week and he usually works half of the day during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If his daily salary is $10, how much does he earn every week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate Ludwig's earnings from Monday to Thursday.
            <p>Since Ludwig works full days from Monday to Thursday and earns $10 per day, we multiply his daily salary by the number of days:</p>
            <p>$10 × 4 = $40</p>
            <p>Ludwig earns $40 from Monday to Thursday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate Ludwig's daily earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
            <p>Since Ludwig works half days on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, his daily earnings for these days will be half of his regular daily salary:</p>
            <p>$10 ÷ 2 = $5</p>
            <p>Ludwig earns $5 per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Ludwig's total earnings for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
            <p>To find the total earnings for these three days, we multiply the half-day rate by the number of weekend days:</p>
            <p>$5 × 2 = $10</p>
            <p>Ludwig earns $10 in total for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Ludwig's total weekly earnings.
            <p>To find the total weekly earnings, we add the earnings from Monday to Thursday to the earnings from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:</p>
            <p>$40 + $10 = $50</p>
            <p>Ludwig earns $50 every week.</p>
        </div>
