    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        James earns $10 per week as an allowance. After saving all his money for four weeks, he spends half of it on a new video game. He then spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book. How much money does he have left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total amount James saved over four weeks.
            <p>James earns $10 per week, and he saved for 4 weeks.</p>
            <p>Total savings = $10 × 4 = $40</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much James spent on the video game.
            <p>James spent half of his total savings on the video game.</p>
            <p>Video game cost = $40 ÷ 2 = $20</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much money James has left after buying the video game.
            <p>Money after buying the video game = Total savings - Video game cost</p>
            <p>Money after buying the video game = $40 - $20 = $20</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much James spent on the book.
            <p>James spent a quarter of his remaining money on the book.</p>
            <p>Book cost = $20 ÷ 4 = $5</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how much money James has left after buying both items.
            <p>Money left = Money after buying the video game - Book cost</p>
            <p>Money left = $20 - $10 = $10</p>
        </div>
