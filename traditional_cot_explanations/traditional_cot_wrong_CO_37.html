    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        It's exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On Monday, he studies for 4 hours then studies for twice this long on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day. He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many hours Tristan studies on Tuesday.
            <p>Since Tristan studies twice as long on Tuesday as he does on Monday, we multiply Monday's hours by 2:</p>
            <p>Tuesday hours = 4 hours × 2 = 8 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total hours studied from Monday through Friday.
            <p>We need to add up all the weekday study hours:</p>
            <p>Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday</p>
            <p>= 4 hours + 8 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours</p>
            <p>= 21 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the remaining hours to be studied over the weekend.
            <p>Tristan wants to study for a total of 25 hours, so we subtract the weekday hours from the total:</p>
            <p>Weekend hours = 25 hours - 21 hours = 4 hours</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Saturday's study hours by dividing the weekend hours by the number of weekend days.
            <p>The 4 remaining hours need to be divided evenly between Saturday and Sunday:</p>
            <p>Saturday hours = 4 hours ÷ 1 = 4 hours</p>
