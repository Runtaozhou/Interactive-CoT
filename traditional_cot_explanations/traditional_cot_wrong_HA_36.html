    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        There are 15 cats in a shelter. One-third were adopted, and were replaced with twice the amount that were adopted. Later on, twice as many dogs showed up as there are cats. How many total animals are there in the shelter?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many cats were adopted.
            <p>We need to find one-third of the initial 15 cats:</p>
            <p>15 ÷ 3 = 5 cats were adopted</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many cats remained after adoption.
            <p>We subtract the adopted cats from the initial number:</p>
            <p>15 - 5 = 10 cats remained in the shelter</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many new cats were added to the shelter.
            <p>The shelter received twice the number of cats that were adopted, plus 3 additional cats:</p>
            <p>5 × 2 = 10 more cats, plus 3 additional cats = 13 new cats</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of cats in the shelter.
            <p>We add the remaining cats and the new cats:</p>
            <p>10 + 10 + 3 = 23 cats in total</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many dogs showed up.
            <p>Twice as many dogs showed up as there are cats:</p>
            <p>23 × 2 = 46 dogs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total number of animals in the shelter.
            <p>We add the total number of cats and dogs:</p>
            <p>23 + 46 = 69 animals</p>
        </div>
    </div>
