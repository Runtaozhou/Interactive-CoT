    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Micah bought envelopes to send, and depending on the weight of the envelope he will need more stamps. If an envelope weighs more than 5 pounds, he will need 5 stamps. If it weighs less than that, it will only need 2 stamps. If he bought 52 stamps with 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, how many envelopes in total did Micah need to buy?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of stamps needed for the light envelopes.
            <p>We know that Micah has 6 light envelopes (weighing less than 5 pounds), and each light envelope needs 2 stamps.</p>
            <p>Number of stamps for light envelopes = 6 × 2 = 12 stamps</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find the remaining stamps after accounting for light envelopes.
            <p>Micah bought a total of 52 stamps, and 12 of those are used for the light envelopes.</p>
            <p>Remaining stamps = 52 - 12 = 40 stamps</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Account for international envelope stamps and calculate heavy envelopes.
            <p>From the remaining 40 stamps, we need to subtract 10 stamps for international envelopes.</p>
            <p>Stamps available for heavy envelopes = 40 - 10 = 30 stamps</p>
            <p>Each heavy envelope (weighing more than 5 pounds) needs 5 stamps.</p>
            <p>Number of heavy envelopes = 30 ÷ 5 = 6 envelopes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of envelopes.
            <p>Now we can find the total number of envelopes by adding the light and heavy envelopes.</p>
            <p>Total envelopes = 6 + 6 = 12 envelopes</p>
        </div>
    </div>
