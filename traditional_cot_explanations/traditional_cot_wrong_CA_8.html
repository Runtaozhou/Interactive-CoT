    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Timmy's parents have a 2 car garage, which has both cars inside it. Also inside is a riding lawnmower, a bicycle for Timmy as well as each of his parents, a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey, and a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices riding on. How many wheels in total are in this garage?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of wheels from the cars.
            <p>Each car has 4 wheels, and there are 2 cars in the garage.</p>
            <p>Number of wheels from cars = 4 × 2 = 8 wheels</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Add the wheels from the riding lawnmower.
            <p>A riding lawnmower typically has 4 wheels.</p>
            <p>Total wheels so far = 8 + 4 = 12 wheels</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add the wheels from all the bicycles.
            <p>There are 3 bicycles (one for Timmy and one for each of his parents), and each bicycle has 2 wheels.</p>
            <p>Number of wheels from bicycles = 3 × 2 = 6 wheels</p>
            <p>Total wheels so far = 12 + 6 = 18 wheels</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Add the wheels from the tricycle and unicycle.
            <p>A tricycle has 3 wheels, and a unicycle has 1 wheel.</p>
            <p>Total wheels = 18 + 3 + 1 = 20 wheels</p>
        </div>
