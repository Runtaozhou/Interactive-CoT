    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Francis' family has 2 ukuleles, 4 guitars, and a certain number of violins. Each ukulele has 4 strings. Each guitar has 6 strings. Each violin has 4 strings. If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of strings from the guitars.
            <p>We know there are 4 guitars, and each guitar has 6 strings.</p>
            <p>Number of guitars × Strings per guitar = 4 × 6 = 24 strings</p>
            <p>So, the guitars have a total of 24 strings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find the number of strings from the violins by subtracting guitar strings from the total.
            <p>The total number of strings is 40, and the guitars account for 24 strings.</p>
            <p>Total strings - Guitar strings = 40 - 24 = 16 strings</p>
            <p>So, the violins have a total of 16 strings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of violins by dividing the violin strings by strings per violin.
            <p>Each violin has 4 strings, and we have 16 strings in total from violins.</p>
            <p>Violin strings ÷ Strings per violin = 16 ÷ 4 = 4 violins</p>
            <p>Therefore, Francis' family has 4 violins.</p>
