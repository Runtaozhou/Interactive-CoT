    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jill is going to resod her front yard. The plot of land in front of her house is 200 feet wide by 50 feet. Her house has a sidewalk that is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long. There are also four flower beds: two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, one that is 10 feet by 12 feet, and a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total area of the front yard.
            <p>To find the total area, we multiply the width by the length:</p>
            <p>Total yard area = 200 ft × 50 ft = 10,000 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the area of the sidewalk.
            <p>Using the perimeter calculation:</p>
            <p>Sidewalk area = 3ft + 50ft + 3ft + 50ft = 106 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the area of the two flower beds in front of the house.
            <p>For each flower bed: Area = depth × length</p>
            <p>Area of one flower bed = 4 ft × 25 ft = 100 square feet</p>
            <p>Total area of two flower beds = 2 × 100 square feet = 200 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the area of the third flower bed.
            <p>Area = width × length</p>
            <p>Area of third flower bed = 10 ft × 12 ft = 120 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the area of the fourth flower bed.
            <p>Area = width × length</p>
            <p>Area of fourth flower bed = 7 ft × 8 ft = 56 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total area of the sidewalk and flower beds.
            <p>Total non-sod area = sidewalk area + front flower beds area + third flower bed area + fourth flower bed area</p>
            <p>Total non-sod area = 106 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = 482 square feet</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the area that needs sod by subtracting the non-sod areas from the total yard area.
            <p>Sod area needed = total yard area - total non-sod area</p>
            <p>Sod area needed = 10,000 sq.ft - 482 sq.ft = 9,518 square feet</p>
        </div>
