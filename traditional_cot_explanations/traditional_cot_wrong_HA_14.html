    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Grace baked 4 whole pumpkin pies. She sold 1 whole pumpkin pie and gave 1 whole pumpkin pie to her friend. The remaining whole pumpkin pies were each sliced into 6 pieces. Her family ate 2/3 pieces. How many pieces of pumpkin pie were left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of pies Grace gave away or sold.
            <p>Grace sold 1 pie and gave away 1 pie to her friend.</p>
            <p>Total pies given away or sold = 1 + 1 = 2 pies</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Find how many whole pies remained for Grace's family.
            <p>Grace started with 4 pies total and gave away or sold 2 pies.</p>
            <p>Remaining pies = 4 - 2 = 2 pies</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of pieces from the remaining pies.
            <p>Each remaining pie was sliced into 6 pieces.</p>
            <p>Total pieces = 2 pies × 6 pieces per pie = 12 pieces</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many pieces the family ate.
            <p>The family ate 2/3 of the total pieces.</p>
            <p>Pieces eaten = 12 pieces × 2/3 = 8 pieces</p>
            <p>Additionally, 1 piece was given to the dog.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the number of pieces left.
            <p>We need to subtract the pieces eaten by the family and the dog from the total pieces.</p>
            <p>Pieces left = 12 - 8 - 1 = 3 pieces</p>
        </div>
