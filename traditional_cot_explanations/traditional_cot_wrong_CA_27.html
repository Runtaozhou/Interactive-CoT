    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Alice made 52 friendship bracelets over spring break to sell at school. It only cost her $3.00 in materials to make these bracelets. During the break, she gave 8 of her bracelets away. Back at school, she sells all of the remaining bracelets at $0.25 each. How much profit did she make (money earned after paying initial costs) on the sale of her bracelets?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to calculate how many bracelets Alice had left to sell after giving some away. Alice made 52 bracelets in total and gave away 8 of them.
            <br>
            Number of bracelets left to sell = 52 - 8 = 44 bracelets
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, we need to calculate the total money earned from selling the remaining bracelets. Alice sold each bracelet for $0.25.
            <br>
            Total sales = 44 bracelets × $0.25 per bracelet = $10.00
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total sales. The initial cost of materials was $3.00.
            <br>
            Profit = Total sales - Initial cost = $10.00 - $3.00 = $7.00
        </div>
