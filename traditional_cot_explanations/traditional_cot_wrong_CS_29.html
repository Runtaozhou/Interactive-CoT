    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A fixer uses 30% of the nails in a container to repair the kitchen. He also used 70% of the remaining nails in the container to repair the fence. If there were 400 nails in the container, how many nails are remaining?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many nails were used to fix the kitchen.
            <p>We need to find 30% of the total 400 nails:</p>
            <p>30/100 × 400 = 120 nails</p>
            <p>So, 120 nails were used for the kitchen repair.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many nails remain after fixing the kitchen.
            <p>We subtract the nails used for the kitchen from the total:</p>
            <p>400 - 120 = 280 nails</p>
            <p>After the kitchen repair, 280 nails remain in the container.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many nails were used to fix the fence.
            <p>The fixer used 70% of the remaining 280 nails for the fence:</p>
            <p>70/100 × 280 = 196 nails</p>
            <p>So, 196 nails were used for the fence repair.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the final number of remaining nails.
            <p>We subtract the nails used for the fence from the nails that remained after the kitchen repair:</p>
            <p>280 - 190 = 90 nails</p>
            <p>Therefore, 90 nails remain in the container after both repairs.</p>
        </div>

        90
