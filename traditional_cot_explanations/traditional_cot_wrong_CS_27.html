    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the remaining food after 30 days
            <p>We need to determine how many days of food are left after the first 30 days have passed.</p>
            <p>Total days of food initially: 90 days</p>
            <p>Days already passed: 30 days</p>
            <p>Remaining days for the original group: 90 days - 30 days = 60 days</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the number of people remaining in the castle
            <p>After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle.</p>
            <p>Original number of people: 300 people</p>
            <p>People who left: 100 people</p>
            <p>Remaining people: 300 - 100 = 200 people</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the food consumption rate of the smaller group relative to the original group
            <p>With fewer people, the food will last longer. We need to calculate the ratio of consumption.</p>
            <p>Consumption rate = Remaining people / Original people</p>
            <p>Consumption rate = 200/300 = 2/3</p>
            <p>This means the remaining group consumes food at 2/3 the rate of the original group.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how long the remaining food will last for the smaller group
            <p>Since the consumption rate is now 2/3 of the original, the food will last longer.</p>
            <p>Days until food runs out = Remaining days for original group / Consumption rate</p>
            <p>Days until food runs out = 70 days / (2/3) = 105 more days</p>
        </div>
    </div>
