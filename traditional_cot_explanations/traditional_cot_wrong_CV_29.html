    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Susan is taking a two week vacation. She works five days a week and has six days of paid vacation. The rest of her workdays will be unpaid vacation time. She gets paid $15 per hour and works 8 hours a day. How much pay will she miss on her vacation?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of workdays in two weeks.
            <p>We need to find how many workdays Susan would normally have in two weeks.</p>
            <p>Days per week × Number of weeks = 5 × 2 = 10 days</p>
            <p>So, Susan would normally work 10 days in two weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the number of unpaid vacation days.
            <p>Since Susan has 6 days of paid vacation, we need to find how many days will be unpaid.</p>
            <p>Total workdays - Paid vacation days = 10 - 6 = 4 days</p>
            <p>Therefore, Susan will have 4 unpaid vacation days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Susan's daily pay.
            <p>To find how much Susan earns per day, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works per day.</p>
            <p>Hourly pay × Hours per day = $20 × 8 = $160 per day</p>
            <p>Susan earns $160 per day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total pay Susan will miss.
            <p>Now we can determine how much pay Susan will miss by multiplying her daily pay by the number of unpaid vacation days.</p>
            <p>Daily pay × Unpaid vacation days = $160 × 4 = $640</p>
            <p>Susan will miss $640 in pay during her vacation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        $640
