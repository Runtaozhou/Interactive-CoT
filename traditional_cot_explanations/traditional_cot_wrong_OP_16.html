    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate how much Cole saved on the jogger jeans. We know that he saved 1/3 of the total savings on the jogger jeans, and the total savings was $6.
            <br>
            Savings on jogger jeans = $6 × 1/3 = $2
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, let's calculate how much Cole saved on the tattered jeans. Since the total savings was $6 and he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, he saved the rest on the tattered jeans.
            <br>
            Savings on tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Let's calculate the sale price of the jogger jeans. We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
            <br>
            Sale price of jogger jeans = $28 - $6 = $22
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> The sale price of the tattered jeans is given as $28.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Now, let's calculate the original price of the tattered jeans. We know that Cole saved $4 on the tattered jeans, so we add this to the sale price.
            <br>
            Original price of tattered jeans = $28 + $4 = $32
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Similarly, let's calculate the original price of the jogger jeans. Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, so we add this to the sale price.
            <br>
            Original price of jogger jeans = $22 + $2 = $24
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Finally, let's calculate how much more the tattered jeans originally cost than the jogger jeans.
            <br>
            Price difference = $32 - $24 = $8
        </div>
