    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        James hurt himself exercising. The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how long the injury would take to fully heal.
            <p>The pain subsided after 3 days, and the injury takes 5 times that long to fully heal.</p>
            <p>Healing time = 3 days × 5 = 15 days</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate when he would start exercising again.
            <p>After the injury heals, James wants to wait an additional 3 days before starting to work out.</p>
            <p>Time until he can start exercising = Healing time + Additional wait</p>
            <p>Time until he can start exercising = 15 days + 3 days = 18 days</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many days he needs to wait before lifting heavy.
            <p>James wants to wait 3 weeks after he starts exercising before lifting heavy weights.</p>
            <p>Wait time before lifting heavy = 3 weeks × 7 days per week = 21 days</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total time until he can lift heavy again.
            <p>Total time = Time until he can start exercising + Wait time before lifting heavy</p>
            <p>Total time = 18 days + 24 days = 42 days</p>
        </div>
    </div>
