    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Christina walks 7km to school every day from Monday to Friday. She returns home covering the same distance. Last Friday her mother asked her to pass by her friend, which is another 2km away from the school in the opposite distance from home. How many kilometers did Christina cover that week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the distance for one round trip to school.
            <p>Christina walks 7km to school and then 7km back home each day.</p>
            <p>Distance for one round trip = 7km × 2 = 14km</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total distance for the week excluding Friday.
            <p>Christina makes this round trip Monday through Thursday (4 days).</p>
            <p>Distance for Monday to Thursday = 14km/day × 4 days = 56km</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the extra distance for visiting the friend.
            <p>On Friday, Christina had to visit her friend which was 2km away from school in the opposite direction from home. She had to travel this extra 2km both ways.</p>
            <p>Extra distance for visiting friend = 2km × 2 = 4km</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total distance for the week.
            <p>We need to add the regular weekday distance and the extra distance for visiting the friend.</p>
            <p>Total distance = 56km + 4km = 60km</p>
        </div>
