    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entrée, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to find the cost of the ticket and entrée for each person. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for the entrée, so the total cost per person is $50 + $10 = $60.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now we need to calculate the total cost of tickets and entrées for all people. Since Jenny and 5 of her friends are going, that's a total of 6 people. So the total cost for tickets and entrées is $60/person × 6 people = $360.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, we need to determine how many people ordered drink tickets. The problem states that half the people bought drink tickets. To find this, we calculate 6 people × 2 = 12 people.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Now we can calculate the total cost of the drink tickets. With 12 people buying drink tickets at $30 per person, the total cost for drinks is 12 people × $30/person = $360.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> To find the total cost of the evening, we add the cost of tickets and entrées to the cost of drink tickets: $360 + $360 = $720.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Since the dinner theater was canceled, each person gets a 90% refund. To find the refund amount, we multiply the total cost by 90%: $720 × 0.9 = $648.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Finally, to determine how much money the friends lost, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost: $720 - $648 = $72.
        </div>
    </div>
