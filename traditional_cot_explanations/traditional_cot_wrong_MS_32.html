    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        At Kaleb's Restaurant, a group with six adults and two children came in to eat. If each adult meal cost six dollars and each children's meal was $4, and every person ordered a soda for $2 how much was the bill?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the cost for children's meals
            <p>We need to multiply the number of children by the cost per children's meal:</p>
            <p>2 children × $4 = $8</p>
            <p>The total cost for children's meals is $8.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of people ordering drinks
            <p>We need to add the number of adults and the number of children:</p>
            <p>6 adults + 2 children = 8 people</p>
            <p>There are 8 people in total who will order drinks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the cost for all drinks
            <p>We multiply the total number of people by the cost per soda:</p>
            <p>8 people × $2 = $16</p>
            <p>The total cost for all drinks is $16.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total cost of the meal
            <p>We add the cost of adult meals, children's meals, and drinks:</p>
            <p>$6 + $8 + $16 = $30</p>
            <p>The total bill comes to $30.</p>
        </div>
