    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Radhika got a new gaming system and asked everyone to get her games as gifts to add to the games she already has that she bought with her gaming system. On Christmas, she is given 12 new video games. On her birthday in February, she is given 8 more video games. Radhika already owned 1/2 the number of games as what she was given on Christmas and her birthday. How many video games does she own now?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of video games Radhika received as gifts.
            <p>We need to add the Christmas gifts and birthday gifts:</p>
            <p>Christmas gifts + Birthday gifts = 12 + 8 = 20 video games</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many video games Radhika already owned.
            <p>Radhika already owned 1/2 the number of games she was given as gifts:</p>
            <p>Total gifts × 1/2 = 20 × 1/2 = 10 video games</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of video games Radhika has now.
            <p>We need to add the total gifts to the games she already owned:</p>
            <p>Total gifts + Already owned = 20 + 15 = 35 video games</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> State the final answer.
            <p>Radhika now owns 35 video games in total.</p>
        </div>
