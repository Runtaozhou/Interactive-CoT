    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many problems remain after the first 20 minutes.
            <p>Total problems - Problems completed in first period = 75 - 10 = 65 problems</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many problems Georgia completed in the second 20 minutes.
            <p>Problems completed in first period × 2 = 15 × 2 = 30 problems</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of problems completed so far.
            <p>Problems completed in first period + Problems completed in second period = 10 + 30 = 40 problems</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many problems are left to solve.
            <p>Total problems - Total problems completed = 75 - 40 = 35 problems</p>
        </div>
