    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Scott runs 3 miles every Monday through Wednesday. Then he runs twice as far he ran on Monday every Thursday and Friday. How many miles will he run in a month with 4 weeks?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many miles Scott runs on Thursday and Friday each day.
            <p>Since Scott runs twice as far on Thursday and Friday as he does on Monday:</p>
            <p>Monday miles × 2 = 3 × 2 = 6 miles</p>
            <p>So Scott runs 6 miles each day on Thursday and Friday.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total miles Scott runs Monday through Wednesday in a week.
            <p>Scott runs 3 miles per day for 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday):</p>
            <p>3 miles × 3 days = 9 miles</p>
            <p>So Scott runs a total of 9 miles from Monday through Wednesday each week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total miles Scott runs Thursday and Friday in a week.
            <p>Scott runs 6 miles per day for 2 days (Thursday and Friday):</p>
            <p>6 miles × 2 days = 12 miles</p>
            <p>So Scott runs a total of 12 miles on Thursday and Friday each week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total miles Scott runs in one week.
            <p>Add the miles from Monday through Wednesday to the miles from Thursday and Friday:</p>
            <p>9 miles + 12 miles = 21 miles</p>
            <p>So Scott runs a total of 21 miles each week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total miles Scott runs in a month.
            <p>Multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the month:</p>
            <p>21 miles × 4 weeks = 84 miles</p>
            <p>So Scott runs a total of 84 miles in a month with 4 weeks.</p>
        </div>
