    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A group of science students went on a field trip. They took 9 vans and 10 buses. There were 8 people in each van and 27 people on each bus. How many people went on the field trip?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of people in the vans.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of vans by the number of people in each van:</p>
            <p>9 vans × 8 people per van = 72 people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of people on the buses.
            <p>We need to multiply the number of buses by the number of people in each bus:</p>
            <p>10 buses × 27 people per bus = 270 people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add the guide in each bus to the total number of people on buses.
            <p>We need to add the number of buses to the total people on buses:</p>
            <p>270 people + 10 guides = 280 people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of people on the field trip.
            <p>We need to add the people in vans and the total people on buses:</p>
            <p>72 people + 280 people = 352 people</p>
        </div>
