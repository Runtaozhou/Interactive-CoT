    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the gross annual salary for Job A.
            <p>To find the annual salary, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked per year.</p>
            <p>$15/hour × 2000 hours = $30,000 per year</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A.
            <p>The tax rate for Job A is 20% of the gross salary.</p>
            <p>$30,000 × 0.2 = $6,000 in taxes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate Nick's net pay at Job A.
            <p>Net pay is the gross salary minus taxes.</p>
            <p>$30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 net pay</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate Job B income after property tax.
            <p>For Job B, we first subtract the property tax from the gross salary.</p>
            <p>$42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000 after property tax</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate income tax at Job B.
            <p>The income tax rate for Job B is 10% on the income after property tax.</p>
            <p>$36,000 × 0.1 = $3,600 in income tax</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate net income at Job B.
            <p>Net income is the income after property tax minus the income tax.</p>
            <p>$36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 net income</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the difference between the higher and lower net income.
            <p>Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) than Job A ($20,000).</p>
            <p>$32,400 - $20,000 = $12,400</p>
        </div>
