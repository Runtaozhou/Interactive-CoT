    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Trip wanted to watch the new action movie in theaters. An evening ticket cost $10 and a large popcorn & drink combo would cost him an additional $10. He noticed on their website, they had a special offer. From 12 noon to 3 pm, save 20% off tickets and 50% off any food combos. How much money could Trip save by going to the earlier movie?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total cost for an evening movie with food combo.
            <p>For the evening show, Trip would pay $10 for the ticket and $10 for the food combo.</p>
            <p>Total evening cost = $10 + $10 = $20</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the savings on the ticket for an earlier movie.
            <p>With the early show discount of 20% off tickets, Trip would save:</p>
            <p>Ticket savings = $15 × 0.20 = $3</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the savings on the food combo for an earlier movie.
            <p>With the early show discount of 50% off food combos, Trip would save:</p>
            <p>Food combo savings = $10 × 0.50 = $5</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total savings by adding ticket and food savings.
            <p>Total savings = Ticket savings + Food combo savings</p>
            <p>Total savings = $3 + $5 = $8</p>
        </div>
