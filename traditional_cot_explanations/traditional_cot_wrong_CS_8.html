    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard with his wife and two children. He sends each of his kids to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers. His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. How many apples does Bill have left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many apples Bill gives to his children.
            <p>Bill has 2 children, and each child gets 3 apples to take to school.</p>
            <p>Number of apples for children = 3 × 2 = 6 apples</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many apples Jill uses for the pies.
            <p>Jill bakes 2 pies, and each pie requires 10 apples.</p>
            <p>Number of apples for pies = 10 × 2 = 20 apples</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of apples used.
            <p>We need to add the apples given to children and the apples used for pies.</p>
            <p>Total apples used = 20 + 6 = 26 apples</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many apples Bill has left.
            <p>We subtract the apples used for pies from the starting number of apples.</p>
            <p>Apples remaining = 50 - 20 = 30 apples</p>
        </div>
    </div>
