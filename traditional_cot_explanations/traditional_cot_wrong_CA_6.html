    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Leo collects stickers. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers in his collection. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many stickers Leo had after last year.
            <p>We need to add the initial number of stickers to the ones he collected last year:</p>
            <p>Initial stickers + Last year's stickers = 100 + 50 = 150 stickers</p>
            <p>After last year, Leo had 150 stickers in his collection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many stickers Leo collected this year.
            <p>This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year:</p>
            <p>This year's stickers = Last year's stickers × 2 = 50 × 2 = 120 stickers</p>
            <p>Leo collected 120 stickers this year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of stickers in Leo's collection.
            <p>We add the stickers he had after last year to the ones he collected this year:</p>
            <p>Total stickers = Stickers after last year + This year's stickers = 150 + 120 = 270 stickers</p>
            <p>Leo now has a total of 270 stickers in his collection.</p>
        </div>
