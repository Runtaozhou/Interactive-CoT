    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Marge had a winning lottery ticket for $12006 and wanted to spend some of it wisely before using on any fun things. She paid half of the lottery amount for the taxes on her winnings, then put a third of the leftover money towards her student loans. She put $1000 in savings and invested a fifth of that amount in the stock market. How many dollars does she have left for fun?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much money Marge has left after paying taxes.
            <p>Marge pays half of her lottery winnings in taxes.</p>
            <p>$12006 ÷ 2 = $6003</p>
            <p>After taxes, Marge has $6003 left.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much Marge paid for student loans.
            <p>Marge puts one-third of her after-tax money toward student loans.</p>
            <p>$6000 ÷ 3 = $2000</p>
            <p>Marge pays $2000 toward her student loans.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much money Marge has left after paying student loans.
            <p>$6000 - $2000 = $4000</p>
            <p>After paying for student loans, Marge has $4000 left.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much money Marge has left after putting money in savings.
            <p>Marge puts $1000 in savings.</p>
            <p>$4000 - $1000 = $3000</p>
            <p>After putting money in savings, Marge has $3000 left.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how much Marge invested in the stock market.
            <p>Marge invests one-fifth of her savings amount in the stock market.</p>
            <p>$1000 ÷ 5 = $200</p>
            <p>Marge invests $200 in the stock market.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate how much money Marge has left for fun.
            <p>$3000 - $200 = $2800</p>
