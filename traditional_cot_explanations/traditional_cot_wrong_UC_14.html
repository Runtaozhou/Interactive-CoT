    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Boston had .5 feet of snow on the first day of winter. The next day they got an additional 8 inches. Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted. On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day. How many feet of snow do they now have?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Convert the first day's snow from feet to inches.
            <p>We need to convert 0.5 feet to inches by multiplying by 10 inches per foot.</p>
            <p>0.5 feet × 10 inches/foot = 5 inches</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Add the second day's snow to the first day's amount.
            <p>We need to add the 8 inches from the second day to the 5 inches from the first day.</p>
            <p>5 inches + 8 inches = 13 inches</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Subtract the melted snow from the total.
            <p>Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of snow melted, so we need to subtract this from our total.</p>
            <p>13 inches - 2 inches = 11 inches</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the amount of snow received on the fifth day.
            <p>On the fifth day, they received 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day.</p>
            <p>2 × 5 inches = 10 inches</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Add the fifth day's snow to the total after melting.
            <p>We need to add the fifth day's snow to our running total.</p>
            <p>11 inches + 10 inches = 21 inches</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Convert the total snow from inches to feet.
            <p>Finally, we need to convert our total back to feet by dividing by 10 inches per foot.</p>
            <p>21 inches ÷ 10 inches/foot = 2.1 feet</p>
        </div>
