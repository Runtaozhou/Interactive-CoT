    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes in one hour using all ovens.
            <p>The baker can bake 5 loaves per hour in one oven, and he has 4 ovens.</p>
            <p>Loaves per hour = 5 loaves per oven × 4 ovens = 20 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes per day from Monday to Friday.
            <p>On weekdays, the baker bakes for 5 hours per day.</p>
            <p>Loaves per weekday = 5 hours × 20 loaves per hour = 100 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked from Monday to Friday.
            <p>There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).</p>
            <p>Total loaves on weekdays = 100 loaves per day × 5 days = 500 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes per day on Saturday and Sunday.
            <p>On weekends, the baker bakes for only 2 hours per day.</p>
            <p>Loaves per weekend day = 2 hours × 20 loaves per hour = 40 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked on Saturday and Sunday.
            <p>There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).</p>
            <p>Total loaves on weekends = 40 loaves per day × 2 days = 80 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked in one week.
            <p>Total loaves per week = Weekday loaves + Weekend loaves</p>
            <p>Total loaves per week = 500 loaves + 80 loaves = 580 loaves</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Calculate the total loaves baked in three weeks.
            <p>Total loaves in 3 weeks = Loaves per week × 3 weeks</p>
            <p>Total loaves in 3 weeks = 580 loaves × 3 = 1740 loaves</p>
        </div>
