    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of people in each aunt/uncle family unit.
            <p>Each family unit consists of 1 son, 1 daughter, and 1 aunt/uncle.</p>
            <p>So each family unit has: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 people</p>
            <p>Therefore, each family unit has 4 people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of aunts and uncles.
            <p>Total number of aunts and uncles = 3 uncles + 4 aunts = 7 people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total number of people from the aunt/uncle families.
            <p>Total people from aunt/uncle families = 7 × 4 = 28 people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Add her mother and brother to get the total number of people.
            <p>Total people = 28 + 1 (mother) + 1 (brother) = 30 people</p>
        </div>
