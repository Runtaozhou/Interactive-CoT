    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, we need to find the number of shoplifters. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks, and the number of shoplifters equals four times that many minus 5.
            <br>
            Number of shoplifters = 4 × 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
            <br>
            Wait, I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate:
            <br>
            Number of shoplifters = 4 × 3 = 12
            <br>
            Then subtract 4:
            <br>
            Number of shoplifters = 12 - 4 = 8
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence. This equals three times the number of shoplifters.
            <br>
            Number of people kicked out for violence = 3 × 8 = 24
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Finally, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting all known reasons from the total.
            <br>
            Number of people kicked out for other reasons = Total - Mask refusers - Shoplifters - Violence
            <br>
            Number of people kicked out for other reasons = 50 - 3 - 8 - 24 = 15
        </div>
    </div>
