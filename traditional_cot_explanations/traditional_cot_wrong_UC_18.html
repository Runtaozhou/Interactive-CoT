    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke's entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the time spent on activities other than the bus ride.
            <p>We need to find how much time is available for the bus ride by subtracting the train ride time from the total trip time.</p>
            <p>Total trip time - Train ride time = 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours</p>
            <p>So, the time spent on activities other than the train ride (walking, waiting, and bus ride) is 2 hours.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Convert the non-bus time from hours to minutes.
            <p>We need to convert 2 hours to minutes to work with consistent units.</p>
            <p>2 hours × 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes</p>
            <p>So, the non-train time is 100 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the waiting time for the train.
            <p>The problem states that Luke waits twice as long as his walking time.</p>
            <p>Waiting time = Walking time × 2 = 15 minutes × 2 = 30 minutes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the bus ride time by subtracting other activities from the non-bus time.
            <p>Bus ride time = Non-bus time in minutes - Waiting time - Walking time</p>
            <p>Bus ride time = 100 minutes - 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes</p>
        </div>
    </div>
