    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs in her neighborhood for $10.00 an hour. 5 days a week, after school, she worked at a card shop for 2 hours and made $12.50 an hour. On the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday from her neighbor. How much money did she make over 7 days?

    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much Donna makes each morning walking dogs.
            <p>Donna earns $10.00 per hour and walks dogs for 2 hours each morning.</p>
            <p>Daily dog walking income = $10.00 × 2 hours = $20.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much Donna makes in a week from walking dogs.
            <p>Since Donna walks dogs every morning, that's 7 days per week.</p>
            <p>Weekly dog walking income = $20.00 × 7 days = $140.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much Donna makes each day at the card shop.
            <p>At the card shop, Donna earns $12.50 per hour and works 2 hours per day.</p>
            <p>Daily card shop income = $12.50 × 2 hours = $25.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much Donna makes in a week from the card shop.
            <p>Donna works at the card shop 5 days a week.</p>
            <p>Weekly card shop income = $25.00 × 5 days = $125.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how much Donna makes from babysitting on Saturday.
            <p>For babysitting, Donna earns $10.00 per hour for 4 hours on Saturday.</p>
            <p>Babysitting income = $10.00 × 4 hours = $40.00</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate Donna's total weekly income.
            <p>We add all sources of income for the week:</p>
            <p>Total weekly income = $140.00 (dog walking) + $135.00 (card shop) + $40.00 (babysitting) = $315.00</p>
