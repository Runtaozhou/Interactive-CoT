    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Valerie earns $5000 per month, 1/2 of what her brother earns. If their mother earns twice their combined salary, what's the total amount of money they all have together?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much Valerie's brother earns.
            <p>Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns twice as much as Valerie.</p>
            <p>Brother's earnings = Valerie's earnings × 2</p>
            <p>Brother's earnings = $5000 × 2 = $10000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
            <p>Combined salary = Valerie's earnings + brother's earnings</p>
            <p>Combined salary = $5000 + $10000 = $15000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate their mother's earnings.
            <p>Mother's earnings = combined salary × 2</p>
            <p>Mother's earnings = $15000 × 2 = $30000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total amount of money they all have together.
            <p>Total money = combined salary + mother's earnings</p>
            <p>Total money = $15000 + $30000 = $45000</p>
        </div>
