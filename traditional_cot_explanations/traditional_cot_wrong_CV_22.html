    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        In one year, the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the number of students at the end of January.
            <p>We start with 10 students and multiply by 3 to find the number at the end of January.</p>
            <p>Initial students × 3 = 10 × 3 = 30 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the number of students at the end of February.
            <p>We take the January number and multiply by 3 again.</p>
            <p>January students × 3 = 30 × 3 = 90 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of students at the end of March.
            <p>We take the February number and multiply by 3.</p>
            <p>February students × 3 = 90 × 3 = 270 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the number of students at the end of April.
            <p>We take the March number and multiply by 3.</p>
            <p>March students × 3 = 270 × 3 = 810 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate the number of students at the end of May.
            <p>We take the April number and multiply by 3.</p>
            <p>April students × 3 = 810 × 3 = 2430 students</p>
            <p>To find the additional students, we subtract the initial number: 2430 - 10 = 2420 additional students</p>
        </div>
