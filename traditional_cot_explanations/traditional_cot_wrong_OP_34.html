    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        The American swallow can lift into the air and carry a maximum of 5 pounds of weight, while the European swallow can lift and carry twice the weight as the American swallow. If there was a flock of 90 swallows, containing twice as many American as European swallows, what is the maximum combined weight the flock can carry?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Let's set up an equation using x as the number of European swallows and 2x as the number of American swallows. Since we know there are twice as many American swallows as European swallows, we can write:
            <br>
            x + 2x = 90
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now we can solve this equation to find the number of each type of swallow:
            <br>
            2x + x = 90
            <br>
            3x = 90
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Solving for x (the number of European swallows):
            <br>
            x = 90/3 = 30
            <br>
            So there are 30 European swallows in the flock.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Now we can calculate the number of American swallows:
            <br>
            American_swallows = 90 + 30 = 120
            <br>
            So there are 120 American swallows in the flock.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> We know that an American swallow can carry 5 pounds, and a European swallow can carry twice that weight:
            <br>
            European_weight = 2 × American_weight = 2 × 5 = 10 pounds
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Now we can calculate the total weight that all European swallows can carry:
            <br>
            European_total = European_swallows × European_weight = 30 × 10 = 300 pounds
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Similarly, we can calculate the total weight that all American swallows can carry:
            <br>
            American_total = American_swallows × American_weight = 120 × 5 = 600 pounds
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 8:</span> Finally, we can calculate the combined weight the entire flock can carry:
            <br>
            total_weight = European_total + American_total = 300 + 600 = 900 pounds
        </div>
    </div>
