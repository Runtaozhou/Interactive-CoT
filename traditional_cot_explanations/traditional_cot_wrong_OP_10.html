    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Andy gets a cavity for every 4 candy canes he eats. He gets 2 candy canes from his parents and 3 candy canes each from 4 teachers. Then he uses his allowance to buy 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given. How many cavities does he get from eating all his candy canes?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> First, let's calculate how many candy canes Andy gets from his teachers.
            <br>
            Each teacher gives him 3 candy canes, and there are 4 teachers.
            <br>
            3 candy canes/teacher × 4 teachers = 12 candy canes
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Now, let's add the candy canes Andy gets from his parents to find the total number of candy canes he was given.
            <br>
            Candy canes from teachers + Candy canes from parents
            <br>
            12 candy canes + 2 candy canes = 14 candy canes
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Next, we need to find how many candy canes Andy buys with his allowance.
            <br>
            He buys 1/7 as many candy canes as he was given, so we multiply the total given by 7.
            <br>
            14 candy canes × 7 = 98 candy canes
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Now, let's add all the candy canes to find the total number Andy has.
            <br>
            Candy canes bought + Candy canes given
            <br>
            98 candy canes + 14 candy canes = 112 candy canes
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Finally, let's calculate how many cavities Andy gets.
            <br>
            Since he gets 1 cavity for every 4 candy canes, we divide the total number of candy canes by 4.
            <br>
            112 candy canes ÷ 4 candy canes/cavity = 28 cavities
        </div>
    </div>
