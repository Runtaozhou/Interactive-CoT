    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Dexter has five pigs. Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how much feed one pig consumes in a day.
            <p>Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day.</p>
            <p>Daily consumption per pig = 4 pounds × 2 feedings = 8 pounds</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how much feed all pigs consume in a day.
            <p>Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 8 pounds of feed per day.</p>
            <p>Total daily feed consumption = 8 pounds per pig × 5 pigs = 40 pounds</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how much feed all pigs consume in a week.
            <p>A week has 7 days, and the total daily feed consumption is 40 pounds.</p>
            <p>Total weekly feed consumption = 40 pounds per day × 7 days = 280 pounds</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate how much feed is left after a week.
            <p>Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, and the pigs consume 280 pounds in a week.</p>
            <p>Feed remaining = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds</p>
        </div>
