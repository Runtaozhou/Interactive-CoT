    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Tobias went to a swimming pool for 3 hours. Swimming every 100 meters took him 5 minutes, but every 25 minutes he had to take a 5-minute pause. How many meters did Tobias swim during his visit to the swimming pool?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the duration of one sequence (swimming + pause)
            <p>We need to find how long each swimming-pause cycle takes. Tobias swims for 25 minutes and then takes a 5-minute pause.</p>
            <p>Sequence duration = Swimming time + Pause time = 25 minutes + 5 minutes = 30 minutes per sequence</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Convert hours to minutes and calculate the number of sequences
            <p>First, let's convert the total time to minutes:</p>
            <p>Total minutes = 3 hours × 50 minutes/hour = 150 minutes</p>
            <p>Number of sequences = Total minutes ÷ Sequence duration = 150 minutes ÷ 30 minutes/sequence = 5 sequences</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the total time spent on pauses
            <p>Since Tobias completes 5 sequences, he takes 5 pauses:</p>
            <p>Total pause time = Number of pauses × Pause duration = 5 pauses × 5 minutes/pause = 25 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the actual swimming time
            <p>To find how much time Tobias actually spent swimming, we subtract the pause time from the total time:</p>
            <p>Swimming time = Total time - Pause time = 150 minutes - 25 minutes = 125 minutes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many 100-meter segments Tobias could swim
            <p>Since each 100-meter segment takes 5 minutes to swim:</p>
            <p>Number of segments = Swimming time ÷ Time per 100 meters = 125 minutes ÷ 5 minutes/100 meters = 25 segments</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Calculate the total distance swam
            <p>Finally, we can calculate the total distance Tobias swam:</p>
            <p>Total distance = Number of segments × Distance per segment = 25 segments × 100 meters/segment = 2500 meters</p>
        </div>
