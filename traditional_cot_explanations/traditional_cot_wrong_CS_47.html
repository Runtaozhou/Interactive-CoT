    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Miss Molly surveyed her class of 30 students about their favorite color. Half of the class answered green, one-third of the girls answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are 18 girls in the class, how many students like yellow best?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many students answered green.
            <p>Since half of the class chose green as their favorite color:</p>
            <p>Number of students who like green = 30 × 1/2 = 15 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many girls answered pink.
            <p>One-third of the girls chose pink as their favorite color:</p>
            <p>Number of girls who like pink = 18 × 1/3 = 6 girls</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Add up students who answered green or pink.
            <p>Total number of students who like either green or pink = 15 + 6 = 21 students</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Find how many students answered yellow by subtracting from total.
            <p>Number of students who like yellow = Total students - (Green + Pink)</p>
            <p>Number of students who like yellow = 30 - 20 = 10 students</p>
        </div>
