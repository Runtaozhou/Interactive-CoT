    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        For a school fundraiser, Tory needs to sell 50 packs of cookies. So far, he has sold 12 packs to his grandmother, 7 packs to his uncle, and 5 packs to a neighbor. How many more packs of cookies does Tory need to sell?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Count how many packs Tory sold to his grandmother. Tory sold 12 packs to his grandmother.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate the total number of packs Tory has sold so far.
            <br>
            Grandmother's packs + Neighbor's packs = 12 packs + 5 packs = 17 packs
            <br>
            So Tory has sold a total of 17 packs so far.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many more packs Tory needs to sell.
            <br>
            Total packs needed - Total packs sold = 50 packs - 17 packs = 33 packs
            <br>
            Therefore, Tory needs to sell 33 more packs of cookies.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Answer:</h2>
    <div class="final-answer">
        33
