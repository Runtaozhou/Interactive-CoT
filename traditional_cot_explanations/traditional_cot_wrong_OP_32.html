    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        Leo had 400 marbles in a jar. He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack, and he gave some of them to his two friends, Manny and Neil. He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles, and he kept the rest. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate the total number of packs Leo had initially.
            <p>We need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles in each pack:</p>
            <p>Total packs = 400 ÷ 10 = 40 packs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many packs Manny received.
            <p>Manny received 1/4 of the total number of packs:</p>
            <p>Manny's packs = 40 × 1/4 = 10 packs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many packs Neil received.
            <p>Neil received 1/8 of the total number of packs:</p>
            <p>Neil's packs = 40 × 1/8 = 5 packs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Calculate the total number of packs Leo gave away.
            <p>We need to find the total number of packs Leo gave to his friends:</p>
            <p>Total packs given away = Manny's packs - Neil's packs = 10 - 5 = 5 packs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Calculate how many packs Leo kept.
            <p>We can find how many packs Leo kept by subtracting the total given away from the initial number of packs:</p>
            <p>Leo's packs = 40 - 5 = 35 packs</p>
        </div>
    </div>
