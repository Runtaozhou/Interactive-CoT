    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        A pet store owner had 12 birds, 9 puppies, 5 cats, and 15 spiders. Half the birds were sold and 3 puppies were adopted. Then, someone left the spider enclosure open and 7 of them went loose. How many animals does the pet store owner have left?
    </div>
    <h2>Step By Step Explanation:</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Calculate how many birds are left after half were sold.
            <p>Initially, there were 12 birds. Since half of them were sold:</p>
            <p>Birds left = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 birds</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Calculate how many puppies are left after some were adopted.
            <p>Initially, there were 9 puppies. After 3 puppies were adopted:</p>
            <p>Puppies left = 9 - 3 = 6 puppies</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate how many spiders are left after some escaped.
            <p>Initially, there were 15 spiders. After 7 spiders escaped:</p>
            <p>Spiders left = 15 - 7 = 6 spiders</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Add up all remaining animals to find the total.
            <p>We need to add the number of cats (which didn't change), birds left, puppies left, and spiders left:</p>
            <p>Total animals left = 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 23 animals</p>
        </div>
    </div>
