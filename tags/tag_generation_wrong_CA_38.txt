## 1. Problem statement

A cheetah can run at a top speed of <fact1>60 mph</fact1>. The gazelle can run for speeds of up to <fact2>40 miles per hour</fact2>. If <fact3>one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second</fact3>, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially <fact4>210 feet apart</fact4> and they both traveled in the same direction?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Cheetah speed: 60 mph</fact1>
<fact2>Gazelle speed: 40 mph</fact2>
<fact3>Conversion rate: 1 mph = 1.5 feet per second</fact3>
<fact4>Initial distance: 210 feet</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Convert the cheetah's speed from mph to feet per second</step1>
<formula>mph × conversion rate</formula>
<calculation>60 * 1.5 = 90 feet per second</calculation>
<var>cheetah_speed: 90 feet per second</var>

<step2>Convert the gazelle's speed from mph to feet per second</step2>
<formula>mph × conversion rate</formula>
<calculation>40 * 1.5 = 60 feet per second</calculation>
<var>gazelle_speed: 60 feet per second</var>

<step3>Calculate the relative speed at which the cheetah catches up to the gazelle</step3>
<formula>cheetah_speed - gazelle_speed</formula>
<calculation>90 - 60 = 30 feet per second</calculation>
<var>relative_speed: 30 feet per second</var>

<step4>Calculate the time it takes for the cheetah to catch the gazelle</step4>
<formula>initial_distance ÷ relative_speed</formula>
<calculation>210 / 20 = 10.5 seconds</calculation>
<var>catch_time: 10.5 seconds</var>
