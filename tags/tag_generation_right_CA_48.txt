## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes.</fact1> Jane picks <fact2>1/4</fact2> of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks <fact3>20 more tomatoes</fact3>, and the following week picks <fact4>twice that number</fact4>. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total tomatoes initially: 100</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction picked first: 1/4</fact2>
<fact3>Second picking: 20</fact3>
<fact4>Third picking multiplier: 2</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> When she picks 1/4 of the number of tomatoes, she goes home with 1/4*100 = 25 tomatoes. </step1>
<formula> 1/4 * 100 </formula>
<calculation> 25 </calculation>
<var>first_picking: 25</var>

<step2> The total number of tomatoes remaining will be 100-25 = 75 tomatoes. </step2>
<formula> 100 - 25 </formula>
<calculation> 75 </calculation>
<var>remaining_after_first: 75</var>

<step3> After picking 20 more tomatoes the following week, the number of tomatoes remaining is 75-20 = 55 tomatoes. </step3>
<formula> 75 - 20 </formula>
<calculation> 55 </calculation>
<var>remaining_after_second: 55</var>

<step4> The next week she picks twice the number she picked the previous week, that is 20*2 = 40 tomatoes. </step4>
<formula> 20 * 2 </formula>
<calculation> 40 </calculation>
<var>third_picking: 40</var>

<step5> The total number of tomatoes remaining after the final picking is 55-40 = 15 tomatoes. </step5>
<formula> 55 - 40 </formula>
<calculation> 15 </calculation>
<var>final_remaining: 15</var>
