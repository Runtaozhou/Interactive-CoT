## 1. Problem statement

Jackson wants to go on a shopping spree, so his mom says she will give him some spending money if he does extra chores. She promises <fact1>$5 per hour</fact1> spent on chores. Jackson spends <fact2>2 hours</fact2> vacuuming, and decides to do this <fact3>twice</fact3>. He also spends <fact4>0.5 hours</fact4> washing dishes, and <fact5>three times</fact5> as long cleaning the bathroom. How much spending money has Jackson earned?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Pay rate: $5 per hour</fact1>
<fact2>Time spent vacuuming (once): 2 hours</fact2>
<fact3>Number of times vacuuming: 2</fact3>
<fact4>Time spent washing dishes: 0.5 hours</fact4>
<fact5>Bathroom cleaning time multiplier: 3 times</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total time Jackson spent vacuuming </step1>
<formula> vacuuming_time × number_of_times </formula>
<calculation> 2 * 2 = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> total_vacuuming_time : 4 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate the money earned from vacuuming </step2>
<formula> total_vacuuming_time × hourly_rate </formula>
<calculation> 4 * $5 = $20 </calculation>
<var> vacuuming_money : $20 </var>

<step3> Calculate the money earned from washing dishes </step3>
<formula> dish_washing_time × hourly_rate </formula>
<calculation> 0.5 * $5 = $2.5 </calculation>
<var> dishes_money : $2.5 </var>

<step4> Calculate the time spent cleaning the bathroom </step4>
<formula> dish_washing_time × bathroom_multiplier </formula>
<calculation> 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours </calculation>
<var> bathroom_time : 1.5 hours </var>

<step5> Calculate the money earned from cleaning the bathroom </step5>
<formula> bathroom_time × hourly_rate </formula>
<calculation> 1.5 * $5 = $9 </calculation>
<var> bathroom_money : $9 </var>

<step6> Calculate the total money earned from all chores </step6>
<formula> vacuuming_money + dishes_money + bathroom_money </formula>
<calculation> $20 + $2.5 + $9 = $31.5 </calculation>
<var> total_money : $31.5 </var>
