## 1. Problem statement

Out of the <fact1>80 students</fact1> who took the biology exam, only <fact2>2/5 of them</fact2> managed to score 100%. If a score below 80% qualified as failing, and <fact3>50 percent</fact3> of the remaining students who didn't score 100% managed to score over 80%, calculate the number of students who failed the exam.

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total students: 80</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction scoring 100%: 2/5</fact2>
<fact3>Percentage of remaining students scoring over 80%: 50</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of students who scored 100% </step1>
<formula> Total students × Fraction scoring 100% </formula>
<calculation> 2/5 * 80 = 32 </calculation>
<var> students_with_100 : 32 </var>

<step2> Find the number of students who did not score 100% </step2>
<formula> Total students - Students with 100% </formula>
<calculation> 80 - 32 = 48 </calculation>
<var> students_without_100 : 48 </var>

<step3> Calculate the number of students who scored over 80% but below 100% </step3>
<formula> Percentage of remaining students scoring over 80% × Students without 100% </formula>
<calculation> 50/100 * 48 = 23 </calculation>
<var> students_over_80 : 23 </var>

<step4> Calculate the number of students who failed (scored below 80%) </step4>
<formula> Students without 100% - Students over 80% </formula>
<calculation> 48 - 23 = 25 </calculation>
<var> students_failed : 25 </var>
