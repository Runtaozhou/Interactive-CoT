## 1. Problem statement

Ellis is going to take a road trip with her family. <fact1>There will be four people total: Ellis, her mother, her sister, and her aunt.</fact1> <fact2>They will be on the road to their destination for 8 hours and drive 8 hours to return home.</fact2> <fact3>Every hour each person will want to drink 1/2 a bottle of water.</fact3> How many water bottles will Ellis' family need total?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of people: 4</fact1>
<fact2>Total travel time: 8 hours each way (16 hours total)</fact2>
<fact3>Water consumption: 1/2 bottle per person per hour</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of water bottles needed per person for the entire trip </step1>
<formula> Water consumption per hour × total hours × 2 (round trip) </formula>
<calculation> 1/2 a bottle × 8 hours going and 8 hours coming home = 8 bottles for one trip. Therefore, for a round trip, it is 8 bottles × 2 = 16 bottles per person. </calculation>
<var> bottles_per_person : 16 bottles </var>

<step2> Calculate the total number of water bottles needed for all people </step2>
<formula> bottles_per_person × number of people </formula>
<calculation> 16 total water bottles for each person × 4 people = 64 total water bottles </calculation>
<var> total_bottles : 64 bottles </var>
