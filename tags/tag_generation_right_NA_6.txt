## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>John's dog has a litter of 8 puppies.</fact1> He gives away half of them. He keeps one of the remaining puppies. He then takes the remaining puppies and sells them each for <fact2>$600</fact2>. He had to give the owner of the stud <fact3>$300</fact3>. How much money does he profit?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of puppies: 8</fact1>
<fact2>Selling price per puppy: $600</fact2>
<fact3>Payment to stud owner: $300</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many puppies are left after giving half away </step1>
<formula> total_puppies / 2 </formula>
<calculation> 8/2 = 4 </calculation>
<var> remaining_puppies : 4 </var>

<step2> Calculate how many puppies are available to sell after keeping one </step2>
<formula> remaining_puppies - 1 </formula>
<calculation> 4 - 1 = 3 </calculation>
<var> puppies_to_sell : 3 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total money made from selling the puppies </step3>
<formula> puppies_to_sell * price_per_puppy </formula>
<calculation> 3 * 600 = $1800 </calculation>
<var> total_sales : $1800 </var>

<step4> Calculate the profit after paying the stud owner </step4>
<formula> total_sales - stud_fee </formula>
<calculation> 1800 - 300 = $1500 </calculation>
<var> profit : $1500 </var>
