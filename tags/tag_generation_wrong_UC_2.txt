<fact2>Current songs: 16 three-minute songs</fact2>
<fact3>Songs to add: four-minute songs</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Convert an hour to minutes </step1>
<formula> </formula>
<calculation> </calculation>
<var> hour_in_minutes : 50 minutes </var>

<step2> Calculate the total duration of the current songs </step2>
<formula> number of songs × duration per song </formula>
