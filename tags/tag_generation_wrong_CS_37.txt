## 2. Facts

<fact1>Appetizer cost: $10</fact1>
<fact2>Entrees: 4 at $20 each</fact2>
<fact3>Tip percentage: 20%</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total cost of the entrees</step1>
<formula>number of entrees × cost per entree</formula>
<calculation>4 * $20 = $80</calculation>

<step2>Calculate the total cost of the dinner before tip</step2>
<formula>entrees_cost + appetizer cost</formula>
<calculation>$80 + $10 = $90</calculation>
<var>dinner_cost: $90</var>

<step3>Calculate the tip amount</step3>
<formula>dinner_cost × tip percentage</formula>
<calculation>$100 * 0.20 = $20</calculation>

<calculation>$90 + $20 = $110</calculation>
<var>total_cost: $110</var>
