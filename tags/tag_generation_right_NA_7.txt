## 1. Problem statement

It took Dad <fact1>5 more than twice as long</fact1> to vacuum upstairs then to vacuum downstairs. He vacuumed for a <fact2>total of 38 minutes</fact2>. How many minutes did he vacuum upstairs?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Upstairs time: 5 more than twice as long as downstairs</fact1>
<fact2>Total vacuuming time: 38 minutes</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Define a variable for the time to vacuum downstairs </step1>
<formula></formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var>D : time in minutes to vacuum downstairs</var>

<step2> Express the time to vacuum upstairs in terms of D </step2>
<formula>2D + 5</formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var>Upstairs : 2D + 5 minutes</var>

<step3> Set up an equation using the total time </step3>
<formula>D + (2D + 5) = 38</formula>
<calculation>3D + 5 = 38</calculation>
<var>Total_time : 38 minutes</var>

<step4> Solve for D by isolating the variable </step4>
<formula>3D = 38 - 5</formula>
<calculation>3D = 33</calculation>
<var>3D : 33</var>

<step5> Find the value of D </step5>
<formula>D = 33 ÷ 3</formula>
<calculation>D = 11 minutes</calculation>
<var>D : 11 minutes</var>

<step6> Calculate the time spent vacuuming upstairs </step6>
<formula>Upstairs = (2 × D) + 5</formula>
<calculation>Upstairs = (2 × 11) + 5 = 27 minutes</calculation>
<var>Upstairs : 27 minutes</var>

<step7> State the final answer </step7>
<formula></formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var>Upstairs_time : 27 minutes</var>
