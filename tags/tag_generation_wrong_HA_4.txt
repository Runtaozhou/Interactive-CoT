## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>5 geckos</fact1> on the kitchen window eat <fact2>6 insects each</fact2>. <fact3>3 lizards</fact3> eat <fact4>twice as much as the geckos</fact4>. How many total insects were eaten?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of geckos: 5</fact1>
<fact2>Insects eaten by each gecko: 6</fact2>
<fact3>Number of lizards: 3</fact3>
<fact4>Lizards eat twice as much as geckos</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total number of insects eaten by the geckos</step1>
<formula>Number of geckos × Insects eaten by each gecko</formula>
<calculation>5 × 6 = 30</calculation>
<var>gecko_insects: 30</var>

<step2>Calculate the number of insects eaten by each lizard and then the total for all lizards</step2>
<formula>Insects eaten by each gecko × 2 × Number of lizards</formula>
<calculation>3 × 12 = 36</calculation>
<var>lizard_insects: 36</var>

<step3>Calculate the total number of insects eaten, accounting for the bird</step3>
<formula>gecko_insects + lizard_insects - bird_insects</formula>
<calculation>30 + 36 - 4 = 62</calculation>
<var>total_insects: 62</var>
