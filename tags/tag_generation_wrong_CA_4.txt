## 1. Problem statement

Harry decided to buy some balloons for his friend's birthday party. <fact1>One balloon costs $0.5</fact1>, and <fact2>a pack of 10 balloons is cheaper and costs only $3</fact2>. Finally, <fact3>Harry wants to bring to the party exactly 14 balloons</fact3>. How much did he need to pay for them?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>One balloon cost: $0.5</fact1>
<fact2>Pack of 10 balloons cost: $3</fact2>
<fact3>Number of balloons needed: 14</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> To buy 14 balloons, Harry should buy one pack of 10, and 4 separate balloons </step1>
<formula> total_balloons - pack_size = separate_balloons </formula>
<calculation> 14 - 10 = 4 </calculation>
<var> separate_balloons : 4 </var>

<step2> The price of 4 balloons is calculated by multiplying the number of balloons by the price per balloon </step2>
<formula> separate_balloons × price_per_balloon </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 0.5 = $3 </calculation>
<var> separate_balloons_cost : $3 </var>

<step3> In total, the pack and separate balloons would cost Harry in total by adding the pack cost and separate balloons cost </step3>
<formula> pack_cost + separate_balloons_cost </formula>
<calculation> 3 + 3 = $6 </calculation>
<var> total_cost : $6 </var>
