## 1. Problem statement

Trip wanted to watch the new action movie in theaters. <fact1>An evening ticket cost $10</fact1> and <fact2>a large popcorn & drink combo would cost him an additional $10</fact2>. He noticed on their website, they had a special offer. <fact3>From 12 noon to 3 pm, save 20% off tickets</fact3> and <fact4>50% off any food combos</fact4>.

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total cost for an evening movie with food combo </step1>
<formula> evening_ticket + food_combo </formula>

<var> evening_total_cost : $20 </var>

<step2> Calculate the savings on the ticket for an earlier movie </step2>
<formula> normal_ticket_price * discount_percentage </formula>

<var> ticket_savings : $3 </var>

<step3> Calculate the savings on the food combo for an earlier movie </step3>
<formula> food_combo_price * discount_percentage </formula>
<calculation> 10 * .50 = $5 </calculation>
<var> food_savings : $5 </var>

<step4> Calculate the total savings by adding ticket and food savings </step4>
<formula> ticket_savings + food_savings </formula>
<calculation> 3 + 5 = $8 </calculation>
<var> total_savings : $8 </var>
