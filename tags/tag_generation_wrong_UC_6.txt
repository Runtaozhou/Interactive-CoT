## 1. Problem statement

Liz roasts <fact1>2 16 pounds turkeys</fact1> every Thanksgiving. She can only roast them 1 at a time because she has a small oven. She roasts each turkey for <fact2>15 minutes per pound</fact2>. If dinner is served at <fact3>6:00 pm</fact3> what is the latest time she can start roasting the turkeys?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of turkeys: 2 turkeys of 16 pounds each</fact1>
<fact2>Roasting time: 15 minutes per pound</fact2>
<fact3>Dinner time: 6:00 pm</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how long it takes to roast one turkey </step1>
<formula> roasting time per pound × turkey weight </formula>
<calculation> 15 * 16 = 240 minutes </calculation>
<var> one_turkey_time : 240 minutes </var>

<step2> Calculate the total time needed to roast both turkeys </step2>
<formula> one_turkey_time × number of turkeys </formula>
<calculation> 2 * 240 = 480 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_roasting_time : 480 minutes </var>

<step3> Convert the total roasting time from minutes to hours </step3>
<formula> total_roasting_time ÷ minutes in an hour </formula>
<calculation> 480 / 50 = 9.6 hours </calculation>
<var> total_roasting_time_hours : 9.6 hours </var>

<step4> Calculate the latest start time by subtracting the total roasting time from the dinner time </step4>
<formula> dinner time - total_roasting_time_hours </formula>
<calculation> 18 - 9.6 = 8.4, which is 8 hours and 24 minutes, so 6:00 pm - 8 hours and 24 minutes is 9:36 am </calculation>
<var> latest_start_time : 9:36 am </var>
