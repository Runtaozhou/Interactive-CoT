## 1. Problem statement

Bob grew corn in his garden this year and ended up with <fact1>50 bushels</fact1>. This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took <fact2>8 bushels</fact2>, while Jerry only took <fact3>3</fact3>. He gave <fact4>12 bushels</fact4> to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted <fact5>21 ears of corn</fact5> from him. If each bushel contained <fact6>14 ears of corn</fact6>, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total corn: 50 bushels</fact1>
<fact2>Terry took: 8 bushels</fact2>
<fact3>Jerry took: 3 bushels</fact3>
<fact4>Linda took: 12 bushels</fact4>
<fact5>Stacy took: 21 ears of corn</fact5>
<fact6>Ears per bushel: 14</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Convert Stacy's ears of corn to bushels</step1>
<formula>ears of corn ÷ ears per bushel</formula>
<calculation>21 ears ÷ 14 ears/bushel = 1.5 bushels</calculation>
<var>stacy_bushels: 1.5 bushels</var>

<step2>Calculate the total bushels Bob gave away</step2>
<formula>Terry's bushels + Jerry's bushels + Linda's bushels + Stacy's bushels</formula>
<calculation>8 bushels + 3 bushels + 12 bushels + 1.5 bushels = 24.5 bushels</calculation>
<var>total_given_away: 24.5 bushels</var>

<step3>Calculate how many bushels Bob has left</step3>
<formula>Total bushels - bushels given away</formula>
<calculation>50 bushels - 24.5 bushels = 25.5 bushels</calculation>
<var>remaining_bushels: 25.5 bushels</var>

<step4>Convert the remaining bushels to ears of corn</step4>
<formula>Remaining bushels × ears per bushel</formula>
<calculation>25.5 bushels × 14 ears per bushel = 357 ears</calculation>
<var>remaining_ears: 357 ears</var>
