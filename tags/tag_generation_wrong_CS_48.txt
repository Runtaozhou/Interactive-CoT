## 1. Problem statement

There are <fact1>50 marbles</fact1> in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally <fact2>20 white marbles</fact2> and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total marbles: 50</fact1>
<fact2>White marbles: 20</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of red and blue marbles combined </step1>
<formula> total_marbles - white_marbles </formula>
<calculation> 50 - 20 = 30 </calculation>
<var> red_and_blue_marbles : 30 </var>

<step2> Find the number of each color (red and blue) since they are equal </step2>
<formula> red_and_blue_marbles / 2 </formula>
<calculation> 30 / 2 = 15 </calculation>
<var> blue_marbles : 15 </var>
<var> red_marbles : 15 </var>

<step3> Calculate the difference between white and blue marbles </step3>
<formula> white_marbles - blue_marbles </formula>
<calculation> 20 - 15 = 5 </calculation>
<var> marble_difference : 5 </var>

<step4> Double the difference to find how many marbles Jack removes </step4>
<formula> marble_difference * 2 </formula>
<calculation> 5 * 2 = 16 </calculation>
<var> marbles_removed : 16 </var>

<step5> Calculate how many marbles remain in the box </step5>
<formula> total_marbles - marbles_removed </formula>
<calculation> 50 - 16 = 34 </calculation>
<var> marbles_remaining : 34 </var>
