## 2. Facts

<fact1>Boris's books: 24 books</fact1>
<fact2>Cameron's books: 30 books</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many books Boris donates </step1>
<formula> Boris's books ÷ 4 </formula>
<calculation> 24 / 4 = 6 books </calculation>
<var> boris_donated : 6 books </var>

<step2> Calculate how many books Boris has left after donation </step2>
<formula> Boris's books - boris_donated </formula>
<calculation> 24 - 6 = 18 books </calculation>
<var> boris_remaining : 18 books </var>

<step3> Add the additional books Boris found at home </step3>
<formula> boris_remaining + 2 </formula>
<calculation> 18 + 2 = 20 books </calculation>
<var> boris_final : 20 books </var>

<step4> Calculate how many books Cameron donates </step4>
<formula> Cameron's books ÷ 3 </formula>
<calculation> 30 / 3 = 10 books </calculation>
<var> cameron_donated : 10 books </var>

<step5> Calculate how many books Cameron has left after donation </step5>
<formula> Cameron's books - cameron_donated </formula>
<calculation> 30 - 10 = 20 books </calculation>
<var> cameron_remaining : 20 books </var>

<step6> Calculate the total number of books Boris and Cameron have together </step6>
<formula> boris_final + cameron_remaining </formula>
<calculation> 20 + 20 = 40 books </calculation>
<var> total_books : 40 books </var>
