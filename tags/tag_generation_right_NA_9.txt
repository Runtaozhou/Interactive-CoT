Larry spends <fact1>half an hour twice a day</fact1> walking and playing with his dog. He also spends <fact2>a fifth of an hour every day</fact2> feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Walking time: half an hour twice a day</fact1>
<fact2>Feeding time: a fifth of an hour every day</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total time Larry spends walking his dog each day </step1>
<formula> half hour × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 30 * 2 = 60 minutes </calculation>
<var> walking_time : 60 minutes </var>

<step2> Calculate the time Larry spends feeding his dog each day </step2>
<formula> hour / 5 </formula>
<calculation> 60 / 5 = 12 minutes </calculation>
<var> feeding_time : 12 minutes </var>

<step3> Add the walking time and feeding time to find the total time spent on the dog </step3>
<formula> walking_time + feeding_time </formula>
<calculation> 60 + 12 = 72 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_time : 72 minutes </var>
