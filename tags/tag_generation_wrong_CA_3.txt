## 1. Problem statement

An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for <fact1>three-quarters of its flights</fact1>, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its <fact2>44 trips</fact2> only amount to <fact3>half the number of trips</fact3> the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>First plane's flights to Greece: three-quarters of its flights</fact1>
<fact2>Second plane's trips to Poland: 44 trips</fact2>
<fact3>Second plane's trips: half the number of first plane's trips</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many flights the first plane makes based on the second plane's flights </step1>
<formula> second_plane_flights × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 44 flights * 2 = 88 flights </calculation>
<var> first_plane_flights : 88 flights </var>

<step2> Find what fraction of the first plane's flights go to France or Germany </step2>
<formula> 1 - 3/4 </formula>
<calculation> 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 </calculation>
<var> fraction_to_france_and_germany : 1/4 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total number of flights to France or Germany </step3>
<formula> first_plane_flights / 4 </formula>
<calculation> 88 daily flights / 4 = 24 flights </calculation>
<var> flights_to_france_and_germany : 24 flights </var>

<step4> Calculate the number of flights to France by dividing the France and Germany flights equally </step4>
<formula> flights_to_france_and_germany / 2 </formula>
<calculation> 24 flights / 2 = 12 flights </calculation>
<var> flights_to_france : 12 flights </var>
