## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many stickers Leo had after last year </step1>
<formula> initial_stickers + last_year_stickers </formula>
<calculation> 100 + 50 = 150 </calculation>
<var> stickers_after_last_year : 150 stickers </var>

<step2> Calculate how many stickers Leo collected this year </step2>
