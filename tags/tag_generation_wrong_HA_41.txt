## 1. Problem statement

Mark just got a new puppy that cost <fact1>$10</fact1>. He also bought enough food for <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>. He knows the puppy eats <fact3>1/3 cup of food a day</fact3>. A bag of food with <fact4>3.5 cups costs $2</fact4>. How much did all of this cost him?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Puppy cost: $10</fact1>
<fact2>Food needed for: 3 weeks</fact2>
<fact3>Daily food consumption: 1/3 cup</fact3>
<fact4>Bag of 3.5 cups costs: $2</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of days in 3 weeks </step1>
<formula> weeks × days per week </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 7 = 21 </calculation>
<var> days : 21 </var>

<step2> Calculate the total amount of food needed </step2>
<formula> days × daily food consumption </formula>
<calculation> 21 × (1/3) = 7 </calculation>
<var> total_food_needed : 7 cups </var>

<step3> Calculate the number of bags needed </step3>
<formula> total_food_needed ÷ cups per bag </formula>
<calculation> 7 ÷ 3.5 = 2 </calculation>
<var> bags_needed : 2 </var>

<step4> Calculate the cost of the food </step4>
<formula> bags_needed × cost per bag </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 2 = 4 </calculation>
<var> food_cost : $4 </var>

<step5> Calculate the total cost including the puppy and a toy </step5>
<formula> puppy cost + food cost + toy cost </formula>
<calculation> 10 + 4 + 5 = 19 </calculation>
<var> total_cost : $19 </var>
