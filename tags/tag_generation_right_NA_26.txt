## 1. Problem statement

Haley is getting ready to watch a comet fly over her house. She spends <fact1>two hours shopping for a telescope</fact1>, <fact2>half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard</fact2>, <fact3>three times the setup time making snacks</fact3>, and <fact4>20 minutes watching the comet</fact4>. What percentage of the total time she spent on all those activities was spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Shopping time: 2 hours</fact1>
<fact2>Setup time: 0.5 hours</fact2>
<fact3>Snack-making time: 3 times the setup time</fact3>
<fact4>Comet-watching time: 20 minutes</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First convert Haley's shopping time to minutes </step1>
<formula> hours × minutes/hour </formula>
<calculation> 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes </calculation>
<var> shopping_time : 120 minutes </var>

<step2> Then convert Haley's setup time to minutes </step2>
<formula> hours × minutes/hour </formula>
<calculation> .5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes </calculation>
<var> setup_time : 30 minutes </var>

<step3> Then find the total time she spends making a snack </step3>
<formula> 3 × setup_time </formula>
<calculation> 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes </calculation>
<var> snack_time : 90 minutes </var>

<step4> Then add the time she spends on each activity to find the total time </step4>
<formula> shopping_time + setup_time + snack_time </formula>
<calculation> 120 minutes + 30 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_time : 240 minutes </var>

<step5> Then divide the time she spends watching the comet by the total time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage </step5>
<formula> (comet_watching_time ÷ total_time) × 100% </formula>
<calculation> 20 minutes / 240 minutes = 8.333...%, which rounds down to 8% </calculation>
<var> percentage : 8% </var>
