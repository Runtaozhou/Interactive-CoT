## 1. Problem statement

Susan is taking a two week vacation. She works <fact1>five days a week</fact1> and has <fact2>six days of paid vacation</fact2>. The rest of her workdays will be unpaid vacation time. She gets paid <fact3>$15 per hour</fact3> and works <fact4>8 hours a day</fact4>. How much pay will she miss on her vacation?

<fact2>Paid vacation days: 6 days</fact2>
<fact3>Hourly pay: $15</fact3>
<fact4>Hours worked per day: 8 hours</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of workdays in two weeks </step1>
<formula> days per week × number of weeks </formula>
<calculation> 5 * 2 = 10 days </calculation>
<var> total_workdays : 10 days </var>

<step2> Calculate the number of unpaid vacation days </step2>
<formula> total workdays - paid vacation days </formula>
<calculation> 10 - 6 = 4 days </calculation>
<var> unpaid_days : 4 days </var>

<step3> Calculate Susan's daily pay </step3>
<formula> hourly pay × hours per day </formula>
<calculation> 20 * 8 = $160 per day </calculation>
<var> daily_pay : $160 </var>

<step4> Calculate the total pay Susan will miss </step4>
<formula> daily pay × unpaid vacation days </formula>
<calculation> 160 * 4 = $640 </calculation>
<var> missed_pay : $640 </var>
