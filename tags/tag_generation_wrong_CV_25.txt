## 1. Problem statement

John decided to start rowing around a square lake. <fact1>Each side of the lake is 15 miles</fact1>. Jake can row at <fact2>twice the speed he can swim</fact2>. <fact3>It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile</fact3>. How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Each side of the lake: 15 miles</fact1>
<fact2>Rowing speed: twice the swimming speed</fact2>
<fact3>Swimming time: 20 minutes per mile</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the perimeter of the square lake </step1>
<formula> 4 × side length </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 15 = 60 miles </calculation>
<var> perimeter : 60 miles </var>

<step2> Calculate his swimming speed in miles per hour </step2>
<formula> 60 minutes ÷ minutes per mile </formula>
<calculation> 50 / 20 = 2.5 mph </calculation>
<var> swimming_speed : 2.5 mph </var>

<step3> Calculate his rowing speed </step3>
<formula> swimming_speed × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 2.5 * 2 = 5 mph </calculation>
<var> rowing_speed : 5 mph </var>

<step4> Calculate the time it takes to row around the lake </step4>
<formula> perimeter ÷ rowing_speed </formula>
<calculation> 60 / 5 = 12 hours </calculation>
<var> rowing_time : 12 hours </var>
