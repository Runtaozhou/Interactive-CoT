## 1. Problem statement

In one year, the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If <fact1>there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year</fact1>, how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial students: 10</fact1>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of students at the end of January </step1>
<formula> Initial students × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 10 = 30 </calculation>
<var> january_students : 30 </var>

<step2> Calculate the number of students at the end of February </step2>
<formula> January students × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 30 = 90 </calculation>
<var> february_students : 90 </var>

<step3> Calculate the number of students at the end of March </step3>
<formula> February students × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 90 = 270 </calculation>
<var> march_students : 270 </var>

<step4> Calculate the number of students at the end of April </step4>
<formula> March students × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 270 = 810 </calculation>
<var> april_students : 810 </var>

<step5> Calculate the number of students at the end of May </step5>
<formula> April students × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 810 = 2430 </calculation>
<var> may_students : 2430 </var>
