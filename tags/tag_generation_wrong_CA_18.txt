## 1. Problem statement

Every day, Lou works out by running <fact1>three miles</fact1> on a circular track that is <fact2>one-quarter of a mile long</fact2>. His wife, Rosie, also runs on the same track at the same time as her husband, but she runs at <fact3>twice the speed</fact3> of her husband. During their workout, how many times does Rosie circle the track?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Lou's running distance: 3 miles</fact1>
<fact2>Track length: 1/4 mile</fact2>
<fact3>Rosie's speed: 2 times Lou's speed</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many times Lou circles the track </step1>
<formula> Lou's distance ÷ track length </formula>
<calculation> 3 ÷ (1/4) = 12 times </calculation>
<var> lou_circles : 12 times </var>

<step2> Calculate how far Rosie runs in the same time period </step2>
<formula> Lou's distance × Rosie's speed ratio </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 2 = 8 miles </calculation>
<var> rosie_distance : 8 miles </var>

<step3> Calculate how many times Rosie circles the track </step3>
<formula> Rosie's distance ÷ track length </formula>
<calculation> 8 ÷ (1/4) = 32 times </calculation>
<var> rosie_circles : 32 times </var>
