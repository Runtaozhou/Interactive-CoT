## 1. Problem statement

Jude bought <fact1>three chairs for his house, all at the same price</fact1>. He also bought <fact2>a table that costs $50</fact2> and <fact3>two sets of plates at $20 for each set</fact3>. After giving <fact4>the cashier $130</fact4>, Jude got <fact5>a $4 change</fact5>. How much did each of the chairs cost?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of chairs: 3</fact1>
<fact2>Table cost: $50</fact2>
<fact3>Plates cost: $20 per set, 2 sets</fact3>
<fact4>Amount given to cashier: $130</fact4>
<fact5>Change received: $4</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total amount Jude paid </step1>
<formula> Amount given - Change received </formula>
<calculation> $130 - $4 = $126 </calculation>
<var> total_paid : $126 </var>

<step2> Calculate the cost of the chairs and plates by subtracting the table cost </step2>
<formula> Total paid - Table cost </formula>
<calculation> $126 - $50 = $76 </calculation>
<var> chairs_and_plates_cost : $76 </var>

<step3> Calculate the cost of the chairs by subtracting the cost of one set of plates </step3>
<formula> Chairs and plates cost - One set of plates cost </formula>
<calculation> $76 - $20 = $56 </calculation>
<var> chairs_cost : $56 </var>

<step4> Calculate the cost of each chair </step4>
<formula> Chairs cost ÷ Number of chairs </formula>
<calculation> $56/3 = $18.67 </calculation>
<var> each_chair_cost : $18.67 </var>
