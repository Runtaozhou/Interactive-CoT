## 2. Facts

<fact1>Cost of flour: $5</fact1>
<fact2>Cost of cake stand: $28</fact2>
<fact3>Payment in bills: two $20 bills</fact3>
<fact4>Payment in coins: $3</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total cost of the items Faith bought</step1>
<formula>cost of flour + cost of cake stand</formula>
<calculation>$28 + $5 = $33</calculation>
<var>total_cost: $33</var>

<step2>Calculate the amount Faith paid in bills</step2>
<formula>number of bills × value of each bill</formula>
<calculation>$20 x 2 = $40</calculation>
<var>bill_payment: $40</var>

<step3>Calculate the total amount Faith gave to the cashier</step3>
<formula>bill_payment + coin_payment</formula>
<calculation>$40 + $4 = $44</calculation>
<var>total_payment: $44</var>

<step4>Calculate the change Faith will receive</step4>
<formula>total_payment - total_cost</formula>
<calculation>$44 - $33 = $11</calculation>
<var>change: $11</var>
