## 1. Problem statement

A cheetah can run at a top speed of <fact1>60 mph</fact1>. The gazelle can run for speeds of up to <fact2>40 miles per hour</fact2>. If <fact3>one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second</fact3>, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially <fact4>210 feet apart</fact4> and they both traveled in the same direction?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Cheetah speed: 60 mph</fact1>
<fact2>Gazelle speed: 40 mph</fact2>
<fact3>Conversion rate: 1.5 feet per second per mph</fact3>
<fact4>Initial distance: 210 feet</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>60 mph is 60*1.5=90 feet per second.</step1>
<formula>Cheetah speed in feet per second = Cheetah speed in mph × Conversion rate</formula>
<calculation>60 × 1.5 = 90</calculation>
<var>cheetah_speed_fps: 90</var>

<step2>40 mph is 40*1.5=60 feet per second.</step2>
<formula>Gazelle speed in feet per second = Gazelle speed in mph × Conversion rate</formula>
<calculation>40 × 1.5 = 60</calculation>
<var>gazelle_speed_fps: 60</var>

<step3>Thus, for every second, the cheetah advances on the gazelle by 90-60=30 feet per second.</step3>
<formula>Relative speed = Cheetah speed - Gazelle speed</formula>
<calculation>90 - 60 = 30</calculation>
<var>relative_speed: 30</var>

<step4>To close on a distance of 200 feet, it would take the cheetah 210/30=7 seconds to catch the gazelle.</step4>
<formula>Time = Distance ÷ Relative speed</formula>
<calculation>210 ÷ 30 = 7</calculation>
<var>time_to_catch: 7</var>
