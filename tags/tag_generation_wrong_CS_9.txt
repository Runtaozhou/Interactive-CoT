## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>James hurt himself exercising. The pain subsided after 3 days</fact1>, but he knew that <fact2>the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal</fact2>. After that, <fact3>he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again</fact3>. If <fact4>he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again</fact4>, how long until he can lift heavy again?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Pain subsided after: 3 days</fact1>
<fact2>Injury healing time: 5 times pain subsiding time</fact2>
<fact3>Additional wait before working out: 3 days</fact3>
<fact4>Wait before lifting heavy: 3 weeks</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how long the injury would take to fully heal</step1>
<formula>Pain subsided days × 5</formula>
<calculation>3 * 5 = 15 days</calculation>
<var>healing_time: 15 days</var>

<step2>Calculate when he would start exercising again</step2>
<formula>Healing time + Additional wait</formula>
<calculation>15 + 3 = 18 days</calculation>
<var>exercise_start_time: 18 days</var>

<step3>Calculate how many days he needs to wait before lifting heavy</step3>
<formula>3 weeks × 7 days per week</formula>
<calculation>3 * 7 = 21 days</calculation>
<var>heavy_lifting_wait: 21 days</var>

<step4>Calculate the total time until he can lift heavy again</step4>
<formula>Exercise start time + Heavy lifting wait</formula>
<calculation>18 + 24 = 42 days</calculation>
<var>total_wait: 42 days</var>
