## 1. Problem statement

There are <fact1>15 cats</fact1> in a shelter. <fact2>One-third</fact2> were adopted, and were replaced with <fact3>twice the amount</fact3> that were adopted. Later on, <fact4>twice as many dogs</fact4> showed up as there are cats. How many total animals are there in the shelter?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial cats: 15</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction adopted: 1/3</fact2>
<fact3>Replacement ratio: 2 times adopted cats</fact3>
<fact4>Dogs ratio: 2 times current cats</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many cats were adopted </step1>
<formula> total cats × fraction adopted </formula>
<calculation> 15/3 = 5 cats </calculation>
<var> adopted_cats : 5 cats </var>

<step2> Calculate how many cats remained in the shelter </step2>
<formula> initial cats - adopted cats </formula>
<calculation> 15 - 5 = 10 cats </calculation>
<var> remaining_cats : 10 cats </var>

<step3> Calculate how many new cats were added </step3>
<formula> adopted cats × replacement ratio </formula>
<calculation> 5 * 2 = 10 cats </calculation>
<var> new_cats : 10 cats </var>

<step4> Calculate the total number of cats after replacements </step4>
<formula> remaining cats + new cats </formula>
<calculation> 10 + 10 = 20 cats </calculation>
<var> total_cats_after_replacement : 20 cats </var>

<step5> Add more cats from a litter of kittens </step5>
<formula> total cats after replacement + new kittens </formula>
<calculation> 20 + 4 = 24 cats </calculation>
<var> final_cats : 24 cats </var>

<step6> Calculate how many dogs showed up </step6>
<formula> final cats × dog ratio </formula>
<calculation> 24 * 2 = 48 dogs </calculation>
<var> dogs : 48 dogs </var>

<step7> Calculate the total number of animals </step7>
<formula> final cats + dogs </formula>
<calculation> 24 + 48 = 72 animals </calculation>
<var> total_animals : 72 animals </var>
