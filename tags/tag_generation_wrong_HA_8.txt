## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Marc bought 5 model cars that cost $20 each</fact1> and <fact2>5 bottles of paint that cost $10 each</fact2>. He also bought <fact3>5 paintbrushes that cost $2 each</fact3>. How much did Marc spend in total?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Model cars: 5 at $20 each</fact1>
<fact2>Bottles of paint: 5 at $10 each</fact2>
<fact3>Paintbrushes: 5 at $2 each</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total cost of the model cars</step1>
<formula>number of cars × cost per car</formula>
<calculation>$20 × 5 = $100</calculation>
<var>model_cars_cost: $100</var>

<step2>Calculate the total cost of the bottles of paint</step2>
<formula>number of bottles × cost per bottle</formula>
<calculation>$10 × 5 = $50</calculation>
<var>paint_bottles_cost: $50</var>

<step3>Calculate the total cost of the paintbrushes and add the cost of a model display case</step3>
<formula>number of paintbrushes × cost per paintbrush + display case cost</formula>
<calculation>$2 × 5 = $10, plus $30 for the display case</calculation>
<var>paintbrushes_cost: $10</var>
<var>display_case_cost: $30</var>

<step4>Calculate the total amount Marc spent</step4>
<formula>model_cars_cost + paint_bottles_cost + paintbrushes_cost + display_case_cost</formula>
<calculation>$100 + $50 + $10 + $30 = $190</calculation>
<var>total_cost: $190</var>
