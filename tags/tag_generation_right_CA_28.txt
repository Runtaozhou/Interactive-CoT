## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>John climbs 3 staircases.</fact1> <fact2>The first staircase has 20 steps.</fact2> <fact3>The next has twice as many steps as the first.</fact3> <fact4>The final staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second one.</fact4> <fact5>Each step is 0.5 feet.</fact5> How many feet did he climb?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of staircases: 3</fact1>
<fact2>First staircase steps: 20</fact2>
<fact3>Second staircase: 2 times first staircase</fact3>
<fact4>Third staircase: 10 fewer steps than second</fact4>
<fact5>Height per step: 0.5 feet</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1>The second flight had 20*2=40 steps</step1>
<formula>first_staircase * 2</formula>
<calculation>20 * 2 = 40</calculation>
<var>second_staircase: 40</var>

<step2>The third had 40-10=30 steps</step2>
<formula>second_staircase - 10</formula>
<calculation>40 - 10 = 30</calculation>
<var>third_staircase: 30</var>

<step3>So in total, he climbed 20+40+30=90 steps</step3>
<formula>first_staircase + second_staircase + third_staircase</formula>
<calculation>20 + 40 + 30 = 90</calculation>
<var>total_steps: 90</var>

<step4>So he climbed 90*.5=45 feet</step4>
<formula>total_steps * height_per_step</formula>
<calculation>90 * 0.5 = 45</calculation>
<var>total_height: 45</var>

## 4. Wrongsteps

<wrongstep>4</wrongstep>

## 5. Output

<output>45</output>
