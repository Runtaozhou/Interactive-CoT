Monika went out for the day and spent some money. She went to the mall and spent <fact1>$250</fact1>. Then, she went to the movies and watched <fact2>3 movies back to back that each cost $24</fact2>. Then she stopped by the farmer's market on her way home and got <fact3>20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag</fact3>. How much money did Monika spend throughout her day?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Mall spending: $250</fact1>
<fact2>Movies: 3 movies at $24 each</fact2>
<fact3>Beans: 20 bags at $1.25 per bag</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much Monika spent at the movies </step1>
<formula> number of movies × cost per movie </formula>
<calculation> 24 * 3 = 72 dollars </calculation>
<var> movie_cost : $72 </var>

<step2> Add the cost of drinks that Monika bought at the movies </step2>
<formula> movie_cost + (number of movies × drink cost) </formula>
<calculation> 72 + 3 * 3 = 81 dollars </calculation>
<var> total_movie_cost : $81 </var>

<step3> Calculate how much Monika spent at the farmers market </step3>
<formula> number of bags × cost per bag </formula>
<calculation> 20 * 1.25 = 25 dollars </calculation>
<var> farmers_market_cost : $25 </var>

<step4> Calculate the total amount Monika spent throughout the day </step4>
<formula> mall_cost + total_movie_cost + farmers_market_cost </formula>
<calculation> 250 + 81 + 25 = 356 dollars </calculation>
<var> total_spending : $356 </var>
