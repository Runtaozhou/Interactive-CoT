## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail.</fact1> She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. <fact2>She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately.</fact2> <fact3>She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills</fact3> and <fact4>she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail.</fact4> <fact5>How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?</fact5>

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Stamps needed per envelope: 1 (except electric bill)</fact1>
<fact2>Number of bills: 2 (water and electric)</fact2>
<fact3>Rebates: 3 more than bills</fact3>
<fact4>Job applications: 2 times rebates</fact4>
<fact5>Electric bill stamps: 2</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Valerie has to send a thank you card to each of 3 people, so she has 3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards to mail. </step1>
<formula> 3 * 1 </formula>
<calculation> 3 * 1 = 3 </calculation>
<var> thank_you_cards : 3 </var>

<step2> She has 2 bills to mail. </step2>
<formula> </formula>
<calculation> </calculation>
<var> bills : 2 </var>

<step3> She has 3 more rebates than bills, so 3 + 2 = 5 mail-in rebates to mail. </step3>
<formula> bills + 3 </formula>
<calculation> 2 + 3 = 5 </calculation>
<var> rebates : 5 </var>

<step4> She has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 applications to mail. </step4>
<formula> 2 * rebates </formula>
<calculation> 2 * 5 = 10 </calculation>
<var> applications : 10 </var>

<step5> She has 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send. </step5>
<formula> thank_you_cards + bills + rebates + applications </formula>
<calculation> 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 </calculation>
<var> total_mail : 20 </var>

<step6> The electric bill needs an extra stamp, so she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps. </step6>
<formula> total_mail + 1 </formula>
<calculation> 20 + 1 = 21 </calculation>
<var> total_stamps : 21 </var>
