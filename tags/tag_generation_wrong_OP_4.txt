## 1. Problem statement

Shelly makes braided keychains for her friends at school. Each keychain takes <fact1>12 inches of thread</fact1> to braid. This year, she made <fact2>six friends in classes</fact2> and <fact3>half that number from after-school clubs</fact3>. She wants to make each of them a keychain. How many inches of thread does Shelly need?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Thread per keychain: 12 inches</fact1>
<fact2>Friends in classes: 6</fact2>
<fact3>Friends from after-school clubs: half of 6</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of friends from after-school clubs </step1>
<formula> friends_in_classes * 2 </formula>
<calculation> 6 * 2 = 12 </calculation>
<var> friends_from_clubs : 12 </var>

<step2> Find the total number of friends </step2>
<formula> friends_in_classes + friends_from_clubs </formula>
<calculation> 6 + 12 = 18 </calculation>
<var> total_friends : 18 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total thread needed for all keychains </step3>
<formula> total_friends * thread_per_keychain </formula>
<calculation> 18 * 12 = 216 </calculation>
<var> total_thread : 216 inches </var>
