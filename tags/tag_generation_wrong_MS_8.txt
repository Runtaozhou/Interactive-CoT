Frank went to a shop to buy some food for his breakfast. He bought <fact1>10 buns for $0.1 each</fact1>, <fact2>two bottles of milk, for $2 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a carton of eggs, which was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk</fact3>. How much did Frank pay for his breakfast shopping?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Buns: 10 for $0.1 each</fact1>
<fact2>Milk: 2 bottles for $2 each</fact2>
<fact3>Eggs: 1 carton, 3 times the price of one bottle of milk</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the cost of the milk bottles</step1>
<formula>number of bottles × price per bottle</formula>
<calculation>2 * 2 = $4</calculation>
<var>milk_cost: $4</var>

<step2>Calculate the cost of the carton of eggs</step2>
<formula>price multiplier × price of one bottle of milk</formula>
<calculation>3 * 2 = $6</calculation>
<var>eggs_cost: $6</var>

<step3>Calculate the total cost of all items</step3>
<formula>cost of buns + milk_cost + eggs_cost</formula>
<calculation>10 * 0.1 + 4 + 6 = $15</calculation>
<var>total_cost: $15</var>
