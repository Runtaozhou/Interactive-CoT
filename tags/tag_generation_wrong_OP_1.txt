## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the cost of guest bathroom towel sets</step1>
<formula>number of sets × price per set</formula>
<calculation>2 * $40.00 = $80.00</calculation>
<var>guest_towels_cost: $80.00</var>

<step2>Calculate the cost of master bathroom towel sets</step2>
<formula>number of sets × price per set</formula>
<calculation>4 * $50.00 = $200.00</calculation>
<var>master_towels_cost: $200.00</var>

<step3>Calculate the total cost before discount</step3>
<formula>guest_towels_cost + master_towels_cost</formula>
<calculation>$80.00 + $200.00 = $280.00</calculation>
<var>total_before_discount: $280.00</var>

<step4>Calculate the discount amount</step4>
<formula>total_before_discount × discount percentage</formula>
<calculation>$280.00 * 0.20 = $56.00</calculation>
<var>discount_amount: $56.00</var>

<step5>Calculate the final price after discount</step5>
<formula>total_before_discount + discount_amount</formula>
<calculation>$280.00 + $56.00 = $336.00</calculation>
