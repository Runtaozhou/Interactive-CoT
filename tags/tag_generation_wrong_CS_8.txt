<fact2>Apples per child: 3</fact2>
<fact3>Apple pies: 2 pies, 10 apples per pie</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many apples Bill gives to his children</step1>
<formula>apples per child × number of children</formula>
<calculation>3 * 2 = 6 apples</calculation>
<var>apples_for_children: 6 apples</var>

<step2>Calculate how many apples Jill uses for the pies</step2>
<formula>apples per pie × number of pies</formula>
<calculation>10 * 2 = 20 apples</calculation>
<var>apples_for_pies: 20 apples</var>

<step3>Calculate the total number of apples used</step3>
<formula>apples_for_pies + apples_for_children</formula>
<calculation>20 + 6 = 26 apples</calculation>
<var>total_apples_used: 26 apples</var>

<step4>Calculate how many apples Bill has left</step4>
<formula>starting apples - apples_for_pies</formula>
<calculation>50 - 20 = 30 apples</calculation>
