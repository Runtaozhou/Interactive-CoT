## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of packages: 10</fact1>
<fact2>Cars per package: 5</fact2>
<fact3>Fraction given to each nephew: 1/5</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many cars Tom gave to each nephew </step1>
<formula> Total packages × Fraction given </formula>
<calculation> 10 × 1/5 = 2 </calculation>
<var> cars_per_nephew : 2 </var>

<step2> Calculate the total number of cars given to both nephews </step2>
<formula> cars_per_nephew × number of nephews </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 2 = 4 </calculation>
<var> total_cars_given : 4 </var>
