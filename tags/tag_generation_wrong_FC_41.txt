## 1. Problem statement

Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has <fact1>4 walls</fact1>, with the room being <fact2>20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall</fact2>. One wall has a <fact3>3-foot by 7-foot doorway</fact3>. A second wall has a <fact4>6-foot by 4-foot window</fact4>. A third wall has a <fact5>5-foot by 7-foot doorway</fact5> to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of walls: 4</fact1>
<fact2>Room dimensions: 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall</fact2>
<fact3>Doorway dimensions: 3 feet by 7 feet</fact3>
<fact4>Window dimensions: 6 feet by 4 feet</fact4>
<fact5>Closet doorway dimensions: 5 feet by 7 feet</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the area of the solid wall </step1>
<formula> perimeter of wall </formula>
<calculation> 8 ft. + 20 ft. + 8 ft. + 20 ft. = 56 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> solid_wall_area : 56 sq. ft. </var>

<step2> Calculate the area of the doorway </step2>
<formula> length × width </formula>
<calculation> 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> doorway_area : 21 sq. ft. </var>

<step3> Calculate the area of the window </step3>
<formula> length × width </formula>
<calculation> 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> window_area : 24 sq. ft. </var>

<step4> Calculate the area of the closet doorway </step4>
<formula> length × width </formula>
<calculation> 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> closet_doorway_area : 35 sq. ft. </var>

<step5> Calculate the total area of doors and windows </step5>
<formula> doorway_area + window_area + closet_doorway_area </formula>
<calculation> 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> total_openings_area : 80 sq. ft. </var>

<step6> Calculate the total wall area before subtracting doors and windows </step6>
<formula> number of walls × solid_wall_area </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 56 sq. ft. = 224 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> total_wall_area : 224 sq. ft. </var>

<step7> Calculate the total area Linda will have to paint </step7>
<formula> total_wall_area - total_openings_area </formula>
<calculation> 224 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> paintable_area : 144 sq. ft. </var>
