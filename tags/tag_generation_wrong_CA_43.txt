## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much money Sandra's father gave her </step1>
<formula> money from mother × 2 </formula>
<calculation> $4 * 2 = $8 </calculation>
<var> money_from_father : $8 </var>

<step2> Calculate the total amount of money Sandra has </step2>
<formula> money from father + money from mother + savings </formula>
<calculation> $8 + $4 + $10 = $22 </calculation>
<var> total_money : $22 </var>

<step3> Calculate the cost of the candies </step3>
<formula> number of candies × cost per candy </formula>
<calculation> 14 candies * $0.50/candy = $7 </calculation>
<var> cost_of_candies : $7 </var>

<step4> Calculate the cost of the jelly beans </step4>
<formula> number of jelly beans × cost per jelly bean </formula>
<calculation> 20 jellybeans * $0.20/jellybean = $4 </calculation>
<var> cost_of_jellybeans : $4 </var>

<step5> Calculate the amount of money left after the purchase </step5>
<formula> total money - cost of jelly beans - cost of candies </formula>
<calculation> $22 - $4 - $7 = $10 </calculation>
<var> money_left : $10 </var>
