## 1. Problem statement

There is a playground that is surrounded by a square fence that has a <fact1>side length of 27 yards</fact1>. There is a <fact2>12 yard by 9 yard garden</fact2> that has fencing around it. How many yards of fencing do the playground and garden have together?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Playground fence side length: 27 yards</fact1>
<fact2>Garden dimensions: 12 yards by 9 yards</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total length of the playground fence </step1>
<formula> side length × 4 </formula>
<calculation> 27 * 4 = 108 yards </calculation>
<var> playground_fence : 108 yards </var>

<step2> Calculate the perimeter of the garden </step2>
<formula> 2 × (length + width) </formula>
<calculation> 2 * (12 + 9) = 42 yards </calculation>
<var> garden_fence : 42 yards </var>

<step3> Add the playground fence and garden fence lengths together </step3>
<formula> playground_fence + garden_fence </formula>
<calculation> 108 + 42 = 150 yards </calculation>
<var> total_fence : 150 yards </var>

<step4> State the final answer </step4>
<formula></formula>
<calculation> The playground and garden have a combined fence length of 150 yards. </calculation>
<var> final_answer : 150 yards </var>
