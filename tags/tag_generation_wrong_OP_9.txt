## 1. Problem statement

Adam has <fact1>$100</fact1> and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for <fact2>$5 each</fact2> and sell them for <fact3>$7 each</fact3>. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells <fact4>60%</fact4> of his inventory, how much money does he lose?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial investment: $100</fact1>
<fact2>Cost per rock: $5</fact2>
<fact3>Selling price per rock: $7</fact3>
<fact4>Percentage of inventory sold: 60%</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with his money </step1>
<formula> Initial investment ÷ Cost per rock </formula>
<calculation> 100 / 5 = 20 </calculation>
<var> total_rocks : 20 </var>

<step2> Calculate how many rocks Adam sells </step2>
<formula> total_rocks × percentage sold </formula>
<calculation> 20 x .6 = 12 </calculation>
<var> rocks_sold : 12 </var>

<step3> Calculate how much money Adam makes from selling the rocks </step3>
<formula> rocks_sold × selling price per rock </formula>
<calculation> 12 * 7 = 84 </calculation>
<var> revenue : $84 </var>

<step4> Calculate how much money Adam loses on his business </step4>
<formula> Initial investment * revenue </formula>
<calculation> 100 * 84 = 8400 </calculation>
<var> loss : $16 </var>
