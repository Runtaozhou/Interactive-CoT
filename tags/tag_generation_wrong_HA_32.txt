## 1. Problem statement

Patrick has <fact1>4 hours less than twice the amount of time</fact1> that Greg has left to finish his homework. Greg has <fact2>six hours less than Jacob</fact2> left to finish his homework. If <fact3>Jacob has 18 hours</fact3> left to finish his homework, calculate the total number of hours they all have left to finish their homework?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Patrick's time: 4 hours less than twice Greg's time</fact1>
<fact2>Greg's time: 6 hours less than Jacob's time</fact2>
<fact3>Jacob's time: 18 hours</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much time Greg has left by subtracting from Jacob's time </step1>
<formula> Jacob's time - 6 hours - 2 hours </formula>
<calculation> 18 - 6 - 2 = 10 hours </calculation>
<var> greg_time : 10 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate the total time for Jacob and Greg </step2>
<formula> Jacob's time + Greg's time </formula>
<calculation> 10 + 18 = 28 hours </calculation>
<var> jacob_greg_total : 28 hours </var>

<step3> Calculate Patrick's time based on Greg's time </step3>
<formula> (2 × Greg's time) - 4 hours </formula>
<calculation> (2 × 10) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 hours </calculation>
<var> patrick_time : 16 hours </var>

<step4> Calculate the total time for all three people </step4>
<formula> Jacob and Greg's total + Patrick's time </formula>
<calculation> 28 + 16 = 44 hours </calculation>
<var> total_time : 44 hours </var>
