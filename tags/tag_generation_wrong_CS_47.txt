## 1. Problem statement

Miss Molly surveyed her class of <fact1>30 students</fact1> about their favorite color. <fact2>Half of the class</fact2> answered green, <fact3>one-third of the girls</fact3> answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are <fact4>18 girls</fact4> in the class, how many students like yellow best?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total students: 30</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction answering green: 1/2</fact2>
<fact3>Fraction of girls answering pink: 1/3</fact3>
<fact4>Number of girls: 18</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many students answered green</step1>
<formula>total_students × 1/2</formula>
<calculation>30/2 = 15 students</calculation>
<var>green_students: 15</var>

<step2>Calculate how many girls answered pink</step2>
<formula>number_of_girls × 1/3</formula>
<calculation>18/3 = 6 girls</calculation>
<var>pink_students: 6</var>

<step3>Add up students who answered green or pink</step3>
<formula>green_students + pink_students</formula>
<calculation>15 + 6 = 21 students</calculation>
<var>green_and_pink_students: 21</var>

<step4>Find how many students answered yellow by subtracting from total</step4>
<formula>total_students - green_and_pink_students</formula>
<calculation>30 - 20 = 10</calculation>
<var>yellow_students: 10</var>
