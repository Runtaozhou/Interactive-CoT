## 1. Problem statement

Donna is trying to figure out if her truck is over a particular bridge's weight limit. <fact1>The bridge can hold 20,000 pounds</fact1>. <fact2>Donna's empty truck weighs 12,000 pounds</fact2>. She's carrying <fact3>20 crates of soda that each weigh 50 pounds</fact3>, <fact4>3 dryers that each weigh 3000 pounds</fact4>, and <fact5>twice as much weight in fresh produce as in soda</fact5>. How much does Donna's fully loaded truck weigh?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Bridge weight limit: 20,000 pounds</fact1>
<fact2>Empty truck weight: 12,000 pounds</fact2>
<fact3>Soda: 20 crates at 50 pounds each</fact3>
<fact4>Dryers: 3 units at 3000 pounds each</fact4>
<fact5>Fresh produce weight: twice the weight of soda</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the weight of the fresh produce by doubling the weight of the soda </step1>
<formula> number of crates × weight per crate × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 20 crates * 50 pounds/crate * 2 = 2000 pounds </calculation>
<var> fresh_produce_weight : 2000 pounds </var>

<step2> Calculate the total weight of the dryers </step2>
<formula> number of dryers × weight per dryer </formula>
<calculation> 3 dryers * 3000 pounds/dryer = 9000 pounds </calculation>
<var> dryers_weight : 9000 pounds </var>

<step3> Calculate the fully loaded truck weight by adding the empty truck weight, fresh produce weight, and dryers weight </step3>
<formula> empty truck weight + fresh produce weight + dryers weight </formula>
<calculation> 12000 pounds + 2000 pounds + 9000 pounds = 23000 pounds </calculation>
<var> fully_loaded_weight : 23000 pounds </var>
