## 1. Problem statement

A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge <fact1>$60</fact1> and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge <fact2>$40</fact2>. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs <fact3>6 truck tires</fact3> and <fact4>4 car tires</fact4>. On Friday, the mechanic repairs <fact5>12 car tries</fact5> and doesn't repair any truck tires. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Truck tire repair cost: $60</fact1>
<fact2>Car tire repair cost: $40</fact2>
<fact3>Thursday truck tires: 6</fact3>
<fact4>Thursday car tires: 4</fact4>
<fact5>Friday car tires: 12</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total revenue for Thursday </step1>
<formula> (number of truck tires × truck tire cost) + (number of car tires × car tire cost) </formula>
<calculation> 6*40 + 4*40 = $400 </calculation>
<var> thursday_revenue : $400 </var>

<step2> Calculate the total revenue for Friday </step2>
<formula> number of car tires × car tire cost </formula>
<calculation> 12*40 = $480 </calculation>
<var> friday_revenue : $480 </var>

<step3> Find the difference between the revenues of the two days </step3>
<formula> thursday_revenue - friday_revenue </formula>
<calculation> 400-480 = -$80 </calculation>
<var> revenue_difference : -$80 </var>
