## 1. Problem statement

Ishmael, Ponce, and Jalen measured their weight and realized <fact1>Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce</fact1> and that <fact2>Ponce was 10 pounds lighter than Jalen</fact2>. If <fact3>Jalen weighed 160 pounds</fact3>, calculate the average weight of the three?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Ishmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce</fact1>
<fact2>Ponce is 10 pounds lighter than Jalen</fact2>
<fact3>Jalen's weight: 160 pounds</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate Ishmael's weight based on his relation to Ponce </step1>
<formula> Jalen's weight + 20 </formula>
<calculation> 160 + 20 = 180 pounds </calculation>
<var> ishmael_weight : 180 pounds </var>

<step2> Calculate the total weight of all three people </step2>
<formula> Jalen's weight + Jalen's weight + Ishmael's weight </formula>
<calculation> 160 + 160 + 180 = 500 pounds </calculation>
<var> total_weight : 500 pounds </var>

<step3> Calculate the average weight by dividing the total weight by the number of people </step3>
<formula> total_weight ÷ 3 </formula>
<calculation> 500 ÷ 3 = 166.67 pounds </calculation>
<var> average_weight : 166.67 pounds </var>

## 4. Wrongsteps
