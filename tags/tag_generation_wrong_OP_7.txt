## 1. Problem statement

Paul lives in a <fact1>5th story apartment</fact1>. He makes <fact2>3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week</fact2>. How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if <fact3>each story is 10 feet tall</fact3>?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Apartment floor: 5th story</fact1>
<fact2>Number of trips: 3 trips per day for 7 days</fact2>
<fact3>Height per story: 10 feet</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many full vertical distances Paul travels per day </step1>
<formula> trips per day ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 </calculation>
<var> vertical_distances_per_day : 1.5 </var>

<step2> Calculate the total number of vertical distances traveled in a week </step2>
<formula> vertical_distances_per_day × days in a week </formula>
<calculation> 1.5 × 7 = 10.5 </calculation>
<var> vertical_distances_per_week : 10.5 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total height of the apartment building </step3>
<formula> number of stories × height per story </formula>
<calculation> 5 × 10 = 50 feet </calculation>
<var> building_height : 50 feet </var>

<step4> Calculate the total vertical distance traveled in a week </step4>
<formula> building_height × vertical_distances_per_week </formula>
<calculation> 50 × 10.5 = 525 feet </calculation>
<var> total_vertical_distance : 525 feet </var>
