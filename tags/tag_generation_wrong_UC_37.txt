## 1. Problem statement

Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for <fact1>15 minutes</fact1> to the train center, wait <fact2>twice this long</fact2> for the train to arrive, and then take the <fact3>6-hour train ride</fact3> to London. If Luke's entire trip takes him <fact4>8 hours</fact4>, how many minutes does his bus ride take?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Walking time: 15 minutes</fact1>
<fact2>Waiting time: twice the walking time</fact2>
<fact3>Train ride: 6 hours</fact3>
<fact4>Total trip time: 8 hours</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the time spent on activities other than the bus ride </step1>
<formula> total_trip_time - train_ride_time </formula>
<calculation> 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours </calculation>
<var> time_before_train : 2 hours </var>

<step2> Convert the time before train from hours to minutes </step2>
<formula> time_before_train × minutes_per_hour </formula>
<calculation> 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes </calculation>
<var> time_before_train_minutes : 100 minutes </var>

<step3> Calculate the waiting time for the train </step3>
<formula> walking_time × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes </calculation>
<var> waiting_time : 30 minutes </var>

<step4> Calculate the bus ride time by subtracting walking and waiting times from the total time before train </step4>
<formula> time_before_train_minutes - waiting_time - walking_time </formula>
<calculation> 100 minutes - 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 55 minutes </calculation>
<var> bus_ride_time : 55 minutes </var>
