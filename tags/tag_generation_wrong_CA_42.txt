## 1. Problem statement

At the same store, Peter bought <fact1>2 pairs of pants and 5 shirts for $62 total</fact1>, and Jessica bought <fact2>2 shirts for $20 total</fact2>. Each pair of pants cost the same price, and each shirt cost the same price. How much does 1 pair of pants cost?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Peter's purchase: 2 pairs of pants and 5 shirts for $62 total</fact1>
<fact2>Jessica's purchase: 2 shirts for $20 total</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the cost of one shirt using Jessica's purchase </step1>
<formula> total cost ÷ number of shirts </formula>
<calculation> $20 / 2 shirts = $10 </calculation>
<var> shirt_cost : $10 </var>

<step2> Set up an equation using Peter's purchase with X as the cost of one pair of pants </step2>
<formula> 2X + 5 × shirt_cost = total cost </formula>
<calculation> 2*X + 5 shirts * $10/shirt = $62 </calculation>
<var> X : cost of one pair of pants </var>

<step3> Isolate the variable by subtracting the cost of shirts from both sides </step3>
<formula> 2X + 5 × shirt_cost - 5 × shirt_cost = total cost - 5 × shirt_cost </formula>
<calculation> 2*X = $22 </calculation>
<var> 2X : $22 </var>

<step4> Solve for X by dividing both sides by 2 </step4>
<formula> 2X ÷ 2 = $22 ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> X = $11 </calculation>
<var> X : $11 </var>
