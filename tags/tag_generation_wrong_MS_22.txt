## 1. Problem statement

Anna goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision where she gets <fact1>14 pieces of candy per house</fact1>. Her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in a neighboring subdivision where he gets <fact2>11 pieces of candy per house</fact2>. If the <fact3>first subdivision has 60 houses</fact3> and the <fact4>second subdivision has 75 houses</fact4>, how many more pieces of candy does Anna get?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Anna's candy per house: 14 pieces</fact1>
<fact2>Billy's candy per house: 11 pieces</fact2>
<fact3>Houses in first subdivision: 60 houses</fact3>
<fact4>Houses in second subdivision: 75 houses</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets </step1>
<formula> candy per house × number of houses </formula>
<calculation> 11 pieces/house * 75 houses = 825 pieces </calculation>
<var> billy_total_candy : 825 pieces </var>

<step2> Then subtract the number of houses in the second subdivision from the number in the first subdivision to find the house difference </step2>
<formula> first subdivision houses - second subdivision houses </formula>
<calculation> 60 houses - 75 houses = -15 houses </calculation>
<var> house_difference : -15 houses </var>

<step3> Since Anna gets 14 pieces per house, multiply the house difference by the number of pieces Anna gets per house </step3>
<formula> house difference × candy per house </formula>
<calculation> -15 houses * 14 pieces/house = -210 pieces </calculation>
<var> anna_candy_difference : -210 pieces </var>

<step4> Then subtract this from the total number of pieces Billy gets to find the difference </step4>
<formula> billy_total_candy - anna_candy_difference </formula>
<calculation> 825 pieces - (-210) pieces = 1035 pieces </calculation>
<var> candy_difference : 1035 pieces </var>
