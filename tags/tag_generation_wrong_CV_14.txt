## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Marge had a winning lottery ticket for $12006</fact1> and wanted to spend some of it wisely before using on any fun things. She paid <fact2>half of the lottery amount</fact2> for the taxes on her winnings, then put <fact3>a third of the leftover money</fact3> towards her student loans. She put <fact4>$1000 in savings</fact4> and invested <fact5>a fifth of that amount</fact5> in the stock market. How many dollars does she have left for fun?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Lottery winnings: $12006</fact1>
<fact2>Tax rate: 1/2 of winnings</fact2>
<fact3>Student loan payment: 1/3 of after-tax money</fact3>
<fact4>Savings amount: $1000</fact4>
<fact5>Investment amount: 1/5 of savings</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much money Marge has left after paying taxes </step1>
<formula> lottery_winnings / 2 </formula>
<calculation> 12000 / 2 = $6000 </calculation>
<var> after_tax : $6000 </var>

<step2> Calculate how much Marge paid for student loans </step2>
<formula> after_tax / 3 </formula>
<calculation> 6000 / 3 = $2000 </calculation>
<var> student_loan_payment : $2000 </var>

<step3> Calculate how much money Marge has left after paying student loans </step3>
<formula> after_tax - student_loan_payment </formula>
<calculation> 6000 - 2000 = $4000 </calculation>
<var> after_loans : $4000 </var>

<step4> Calculate how much money Marge has left after putting money in savings </step4>
<formula> after_loans - savings </formula>
<calculation> 4000 - 1000 = $3000 </calculation>
<var> after_savings : $3000 </var>

<step5> Calculate how much Marge invested in the stock market </step5>
<formula> savings / 5 </formula>
<calculation> 1000 / 5 = $200 </calculation>
<var> investment : $200 </var>

<step6> Calculate how much money Marge has left for fun </step6>
<formula> after_savings - investment </formula>
<calculation> 3000 - 200 = $2800 </calculation>
<var> money_for_fun : $2800 </var>
