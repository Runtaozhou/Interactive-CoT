## 1. Problem statement

James is building a hall of mirrors. Three of the walls will be completed covered with glass. If <fact1>two of those walls are 30 feet by 12 feet</fact1> and <fact2>the third is 20 feet by 12 feet</fact2>, how many square feet of glass does he need?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Two walls dimensions: 30 feet by 12 feet</fact1>
<fact2>Third wall dimensions: 20 feet by 12 feet</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the area of one of the long walls </step1>
<formula> perimeter calculation </formula>
<calculation> 30 feet + 12 feet + 30 feet + 12 feet = 84 square feet </calculation>
<var> long_wall_area : 84 square feet </var>

<step2> Then double that amount since there are two walls </step2>
<formula> long_wall_area × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 84 square feet * 2 = 168 square feet </calculation>
<var> two_long_walls_area : 168 square feet </var>

<step3> Then find the area of the short wall </step3>
<formula> length × width </formula>
<calculation> 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet </calculation>
<var> short_wall_area : 240 square feet </var>

<step4> Then add that area to the area of the two long walls to find the total area </step4>
<formula> two_long_walls_area + short_wall_area </formula>
<calculation> 168 square feet + 240 square feet = 408 square feet </calculation>
<var> total_glass_area : 408 square feet </var>
