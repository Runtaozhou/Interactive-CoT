## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.</fact1> When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile. The next day, <fact2>Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile</fact2>, but later that evening, <fact3>Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas.</fact3> On the third day, <fact4>Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile</fact4> and began counting bananas. How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial bananas: 48</fact1>
<fact2>Bananas added on day 2: 25</fact2>
<fact3>Bananas stolen on day 2: 12</fact3>
<fact4>Bananas added on day 3: 6</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many bananas Arnold stole the first time </step1>
<formula> 50 ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 50/2 = 25 bananas </calculation>
<var> first_theft : 25 bananas </var>

<step2> Calculate how many bananas remained after the first theft </step2>
<formula> initial_bananas - first_theft </formula>
<calculation> 48 - 25 = 23 bananas </calculation>
<var> remaining_after_first_theft : 23 bananas </var>

<step3> Calculate how many bananas were in the pile after Gunther added more on day 2 </step3>
<formula> remaining_after_first_theft + day2_addition </formula>
<calculation> 23 + 25 = 48 bananas </calculation>
<var> after_day2_addition : 48 bananas </var>

<step4> Calculate how many bananas remained after Arnold's second theft </step4>
<formula> after_day2_addition - second_theft </formula>
<calculation> 48 - 12 = 36 bananas </calculation>
<var> remaining_after_second_theft : 36 bananas </var>

<step5> Calculate the final number of bananas after Gunther's day 3 addition </step5>
<formula> remaining_after_second_theft + day3_addition </formula>
<calculation> 36 + 6 = 42 bananas </calculation>
<var> final_bananas : 42 bananas </var>
