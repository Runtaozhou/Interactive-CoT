## 1. Problem statement

An avant-garde sushi house sells jellyfish for a certain amount and eel for <fact1>nine times that amount</fact1>. If the <fact2>combined cost of one order each kind of sushi is $200</fact2>, how much does the eel cost?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Eel cost: 9 times jellyfish cost</fact1>
<fact2>Combined cost: $200</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Set up variables for the cost of jellyfish and eel, and write equations based on the given information </step1>
<formula> j + e = $200 and e = 9j </formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var> j : cost of jellyfish </var>
<var> e : cost of eel </var>

<step2> Substitute the second equation into the first equation </step2>
<formula> j + 9j = $200 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>

<step3> Combine like terms to simplify the equation </step3>
<formula> 10j = $200 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var> 10j : $200 </var>

<step4> Solve for j by dividing both sides by 10 </step4>
<formula> j = $200 ÷ 10 </formula>
<calculation> $200 ÷ 10 = $20 </calculation>
<var> j : $20 </var>

<step5> Calculate the cost of eel by substituting the value of j into e = 9j </step5>
<formula> e = 9j </formula>
<calculation> e = 9 * $20 = $190 </calculation>
<var> e : $190 </var>
