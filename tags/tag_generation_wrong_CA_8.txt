## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of cars: 2</fact1>
<fact2>Number of bicycles: 3</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of wheels from the cars </step1>
<formula> number of cars × wheels per car </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 2 = 8 wheels </calculation>
<var> car_wheels : 8 wheels </var>

<step2> Add the wheels from the riding lawnmower </step2>
<formula> car_wheels + lawnmower wheels </formula>
<calculation> 8 + 4 = 12 wheels </calculation>
<var> car_lawnmower_wheels : 12 wheels </var>

<step3> Add the wheels from all the bicycles </step3>
<formula> car_lawnmower_wheels + (number of bicycles × wheels per bicycle) </formula>
<calculation> 12 + 6 = 18 wheels </calculation>
<var> car_lawnmower_bicycle_wheels : 18 wheels </var>

<step4> Add the wheels from the tricycle and unicycle </step4>
<formula> car_lawnmower_bicycle_wheels + tricycle wheels + unicycle wheels </formula>
<calculation> 18 + 3 + 1 = 20 wheels </calculation>
<var> total_wheels : 20 wheels </var>
