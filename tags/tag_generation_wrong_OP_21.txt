## 1. Problem statement

Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for <fact1>each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt</fact1> for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay <fact2>the water bill and the electric bill</fact2> separately. She wants to send <fact3>three more mail-in rebates than she does bills</fact3> and she has <fact4>twice as many job applications as rebates</fact4> to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs <fact5>1 stamp</fact5> except the electric bill, which needs <fact6>2</fact6>?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Thank you cards recipients: 3 people</fact1>
<fact2>Bills to pay: 2 bills</fact2>
<fact3>Mail-in rebates: 3 more than bills</fact3>
<fact4>Job applications: twice as many as rebates</fact4>
<fact5>Regular mail stamp requirement: 1 stamp</fact5>
<fact6>Electric bill stamp requirement: 2 stamps</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the number of thank you cards Valerie needs to mail</step1>
<formula>Number of people × 1 card per person</formula>
<calculation>3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards</calculation>
<var>thank_you_cards : 3</var>

<step2>Identify the number of bills Valerie needs to mail</step2>
<formula></formula>
<calculation>2 bills</calculation>
<var>bills : 2</var>

<step3>Calculate the number of mail-in rebates based on the relationship with bills</step3>
<formula>Bills + 3</formula>
<calculation>3 - 2 = 1 mail-in rebate</calculation>
<var>rebates : 1</var>

<step4>Calculate the number of job applications based on the relationship with rebates</step4>
<formula>Rebates × 2</formula>
<calculation>2 * 1 = 2 applications</calculation>
<var>applications : 2</var>

<step5>Sum up all the pieces of mail Valerie needs to send</step5>
<formula>Thank you cards + Bills + Rebates + Applications</formula>
<calculation>3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8 pieces of mail</calculation>
<var>total_mail : 8</var>

<step6>Calculate the total number of stamps needed, accounting for the extra stamp for the electric bill</step6>
<formula>Total mail + 1 extra stamp for electric bill</formula>
<calculation>8 + 1 = 9 stamps</calculation>
<var>total_stamps : 9</var>
