<fact2>Additional coins: 2 dimes, 10 quarters, twice as many nickels as she has</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total number of quarters after Linda's mother gives her more</step1>
<formula>initial quarters + additional quarters</formula>
<calculation>6 + 10 = 16 quarters</calculation>
<var>total_quarters: 16 quarters</var>

<step2>Calculate how many additional nickels Linda's mother gives her</step2>
<formula>initial nickels × 2</formula>
<calculation>5 × 2 = 10 nickels</calculation>
<var>additional_nickels: 10 nickels</var>

<step3>Calculate the total number of nickels after Linda's mother gives her more</step3>
<formula>initial nickels + additional nickels</formula>
<calculation>5 + 10 = 15 nickels</calculation>
<var>total_nickels: 15 nickels</var>
