## 1. Problem statement

The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is <fact1>2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds</fact1>, respectively. Suppose <fact2>Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy</fact2>; <fact3>2 correct answers in the average</fact3>; and <fact4>4 correct answers in the difficult round</fact4>, what are her total points in the contest?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Points per round: 2 points (easy), 3 points (average), 5 points (hard)</fact1>
<fact2>Kim's correct answers in easy round: 6</fact2>
<fact3>Kim's correct answers in average round: 2</fact3>
<fact4>Kim's correct answers in difficult round: 4</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate Kim's points in the easy round </step1>
<formula> easy_correct_answers × points_per_easy_question </formula>
<calculation> 6 × 2 = 12 points </calculation>
<var> easy_round_points : 12 points </var>

<step2> Calculate Kim's points in the average round </step2>
<formula> average_correct_answers × points_per_average_question </formula>
<calculation> 2 points/round × 3 rounds = 6 points </calculation>
<var> average_round_points : 6 points </var>

<step3> Calculate Kim's points in the difficult round </step3>
<formula> difficult_correct_answers × points_per_difficult_question </formula>
<calculation> 4 points/round × 5 rounds = 20 points </calculation>
<var> difficult_round_points : 20 points </var>

<step4> Calculate the total points from all rounds </step4>
<formula> easy_round_points + average_round_points + difficult_round_points </formula>
<calculation> 6*2 points + 6 points + 20 points = 32 points </calculation>
<var> total_points : 32 points </var>
