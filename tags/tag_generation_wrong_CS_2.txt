## 1. Problem statement

There are <fact1>28 students in a classroom</fact1>. <fact2>Half of them have 5 notebooks each</fact2> and <fact3>the other half have 3 notebooks each</fact3>. How many notebooks in total are in the classroom?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total students: 28</fact1>
<fact2>First half students have: 5 notebooks each</fact2>
<fact3>Second half students have: 3 notebooks each</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many students are in each half of the class </step1>
<formula> total students ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 28 students / 2 = 14 students </calculation>
<var> students_per_half : 14 students </var>

<step2> Calculate how many notebooks the first half of students have </step2>
<formula> students_per_half × notebooks per student </formula>
<calculation> 14 students * 3 notebooks/student = 42 notebooks </calculation>
<var> first_half_notebooks : 42 notebooks </var>

<step3> Calculate how many notebooks the second half of students have </step3>
<formula> students_per_half × notebooks per student </formula>
<calculation> 14 students * 5 notebooks/student = 70 notebooks </calculation>
<var> second_half_notebooks : 70 notebooks </var>

<step4> Add the notebooks from both halves to find the total </step4>
<formula> first_half_notebooks + second_half_notebooks </formula>
<calculation> 40 notebooks + 70 notebooks = 110 notebooks </calculation>
<var> total_notebooks : 110 notebooks </var>
