## 1. Problem statement

Jill is going to resod her front yard. The plot of land in front of her house is <fact1>200 feet wide by 50 feet</fact1>. Her house has a sidewalk that is <fact2>3 feet wide and 50 feet long</fact2>. There are also four flower beds: <fact3>two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long</fact3>, <fact4>one that is 10 feet by 12 feet</fact4>, and <fact5>a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet</fact5>. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Front yard dimensions: 200 feet wide by 50 feet</fact1>
<fact2>Sidewalk dimensions: 3 feet wide and 50 feet long</fact2>
<fact3>Two flower beds dimensions: 4 feet deep by 25 feet long each</fact3>
<fact4>Third flower bed dimensions: 10 feet by 12 feet</fact4>
<fact5>Fourth flower bed dimensions: 7 feet by 8 feet</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total area of the front yard </step1>
<formula> width × length </formula>
<calculation> 200 ft * 50 ft = 10,000 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> total_yard_area : 10,000 sq.ft. </var>

<step2> Calculate the area of the sidewalk </step2>
<formula> width × length </formula>
<calculation> 3ft * 50ft = 150 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> sidewalk_area : 150 sq.ft. </var>

<step3> Calculate the area of the two flower beds in front of the house </step3>
<formula> depth × length × number of beds </formula>
<calculation> 4 ft * 25 ft = 100 sq.ft.; 2 * 100 sq.ft. = 200 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> front_flowerbeds_area : 200 sq.ft. </var>

<step4> Calculate the area of the third flower bed </step4>
<formula> width × length </formula>
<calculation> 10ft * 12ft = 120 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> third_flowerbed_area : 120 sq.ft. </var>

<step5> Calculate the area of the fourth flower bed </step5>
<formula> width × length </formula>
<calculation> 7ft * 8ft = 56 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> fourth_flowerbed_area : 56 sq.ft. </var>

<step6> Calculate the total area of the sidewalk and flower beds </step6>
<formula> sidewalk_area + front_flowerbeds_area + third_flowerbed_area + fourth_flowerbed_area </formula>
<calculation> 150 sq.ft + 200 sq.ft + 120 sq.ft + 56 sq.ft = 526 sq. ft. </calculation>
<var> total_excluded_area : 526 sq. ft. </var>

<step7> Calculate the area that needs sod by subtracting the excluded areas from the total yard area </step7>
<formula> total_yard_area - total_excluded_area </formula>
<calculation> 10,000 sq.ft - 526 sq.ft = 9,474 sq.ft. </calculation>
<var> sod_area_needed : 9,474 sq.ft. </var>
