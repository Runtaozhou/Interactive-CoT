## 1. Problem statement

A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On <fact1>Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes</fact1>. The next day they sold <fact2>double that number of shoes</fact2>. On the last day of the sale they sold <fact3>one-half the amount that they did the day before</fact3>, but <fact4>six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit</fact4>. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?

## 2. Facts

<fact2>Saturday sales: double Friday's sales</fact2>
<fact3>Sunday sales: half of Saturday's sales</fact3>
<fact4>Returns: 6 pairs</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many pairs were sold on Sunday </step1>
<formula> Friday sales × 2 </formula>

<var> sunday_sales : 28 pairs </var>

<step2> Calculate the total sales after returns </step2>
