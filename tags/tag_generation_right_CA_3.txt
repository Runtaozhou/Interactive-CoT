## 1. Problem statement

An airport has only <fact1>2</fact1> planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for <fact2>three-quarters</fact2> of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its <fact3>44</fact3> trips only amount to <fact4>half</fact4> the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of planes: 2</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction of first plane's flights to Greece: 3/4</fact2>
<fact3>Second plane's trips to Poland: 44</fact3>
<fact4>Ratio of second plane's trips to first plane's trips: 1/2</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = 88 flights a day. </step1>
<formula> first_plane_flights = second_plane_flights × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 44 × 2 = 88 </calculation>
<var> first_plane_flights : 88 </var>

<step2> If 3/4 of the first plane's flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights. </step2>
<formula> france_germany_fraction = 1 - 3/4 </formula>
<calculation> 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 </calculation>
<var> france_germany_fraction : 1/4 </var>

<step3> Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = 22 flights to France or Germany. </step3>
<formula> france_germany_flights = first_plane_flights × france_germany_fraction </formula>
<calculation> 88 × 1/4 = 22 </calculation>
<var> france_germany_flights : 22 </var>

<step4> Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = 11 flights to France in one day. </step4>
<formula> france_flights = france_germany_flights ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 22 ÷ 2 = 11 </calculation>
<var> france_flights : 11 </var>
