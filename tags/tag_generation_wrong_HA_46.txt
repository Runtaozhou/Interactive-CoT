## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Grace baked 4 whole pumpkin pies.</fact1> She sold <fact2>1 whole pumpkin pie</fact2> and gave <fact3>1 whole pumpkin pie</fact3> to her friend. The remaining whole pumpkin pies were each sliced into <fact4>6 pieces</fact4>. Her family ate <fact5>2/3 pieces</fact5>. How many pieces of pumpkin pie were left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total pumpkin pies: 4</fact1>
<fact2>Pumpkin pies sold: 1</fact2>
<fact3>Pumpkin pies given away: 1</fact3>
<fact4>Slices per pie: 6</fact4>
<fact5>Fraction of pieces eaten: 2/3</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total number of pies Grace gave away or sold</step1>
<formula>pies_sold + pies_given</formula>
<calculation>1 + 1 = 2</calculation>
<var>pies_given_away: 2</var>

<step2>Calculate how many whole pies remained with Grace's family</step2>
<formula>total_pies - pies_given_away</formula>
<calculation>4 - 2 = 2</calculation>
<var>remaining_pies: 2</var>

<step3>Calculate how many pieces were made from the remaining pies</step3>
<formula>(remaining_pies - 1) × slices_per_pie</formula>
<calculation>(2 - 1) × 6 = 6</calculation>
<var>total_pieces: 6</var>

<step4>Calculate how many pieces Grace's family ate</step4>
<formula>total_pieces × fraction_eaten</formula>
<calculation>6 × 2/3 = 4</calculation>
<var>pieces_eaten: 4</var>

<step5>Calculate how many pieces of pie were left</step5>
<formula>total_pieces - pieces_eaten</formula>
<calculation>6 - 4 = 2</calculation>
<var>pieces_left: 2</var>
