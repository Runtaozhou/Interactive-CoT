## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras</fact1>, each sold at <fact2>$20 per camera</fact2> from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay. Maddox sold his cameras at <fact3>$28 each</fact3>, while Theo sold his cameras at <fact4>$23 each</fact4>. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of cameras bought by each person: 3</fact1>
<fact2>Cost per camera: $20</fact2>
<fact3>Maddox's selling price per camera: $28</fact3>
<fact4>Theo's selling price per camera: $23</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>The total cost of buying 3 cameras from Amazon for both Maddox and Theo was 3*$20=$60</step1>
<formula>3 × $20</formula>
<calculation>3 × $20 = $60</calculation>
<var>total_cost_each: $60</var>

<step2>Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, for a total of $28*3=$84</step2>
<formula>$28 × 3</formula>
<calculation>$28 × 3 = $84</calculation>
<var>maddox_revenue: $84</var>

<step3>Maddox made a profit of $84-$60=$24 from the sale of his cameras.</step3>
<formula>maddox_revenue - total_cost_each</formula>
<calculation>$84 - $60 = $24</calculation>
<var>maddox_profit: $24</var>

<step4>Theo sold his cameras on eBay for $23*3=$69</step4>
<formula>$23 × 3</formula>
<calculation>$23 × 3 = $69</calculation>
<var>theo_revenue: $69</var>

<step5>Theo made a profit of $69-$60=$9</step5>
<formula>theo_revenue - total_cost_each</formula>
<calculation>$69 - $60 = $9</calculation>
<var>theo_profit: $9</var>

<step6>Maddox made $24-$9=$15 more profit than Theo from the sale of his cameras.</step6>
<formula>maddox_profit - theo_profit</formula>
<calculation>$24 - $9 = $15</calculation>
<var>profit_difference: $15</var>
