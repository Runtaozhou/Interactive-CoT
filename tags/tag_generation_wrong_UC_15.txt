## 1. Problem statement

Walter goes to the zoo, where he spends a certain amount of time looking at the seals, <fact1>eight times as long looking at the penguins</fact1>, and <fact2>13 minutes looking at the elephants</fact2>. If he spent <fact3>2 hours and 10 minutes</fact3> at the zoo, how many minutes did he spent looking at the seals?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Time looking at penguins: 8 times as long as seals</fact1>
<fact2>Time looking at elephants: 13 minutes</fact2>
<fact3>Total time at zoo: 2 hours and 10 minutes</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the number of minutes in 2 hours </step1>
<formula> hours × minutes/hour </formula>
<calculation> 2 hours * 50 minutes/hour = 100 minutes </calculation>
<var> hours_in_minutes : 100 minutes </var>

<step2> Then add 10 minutes to find the total number of minutes Walter spent at the zoo </step2>
<formula> hours_in_minutes + additional_minutes </formula>
<calculation> 100 minutes + 10 minutes = 110 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_time : 110 minutes </var>

<step3> Set up equations using variables for time spent looking at seals and penguins </step3>
<formula> s + p + 13 = 110, p = 8s </formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var> s : time looking at seals </var>
<var> p : time looking at penguins </var>

<step4> Substitute the second equation into the first </step4>
<formula> s + 8s + 13 = 110 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>

<step5> Combine like terms </step5>
<formula> 9s + 13 = 110 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>

<step6> Subtract 13 from both sides </step6>
<formula> 9s = 97 </formula>
<calculation> 110 - 13 = 97 </calculation>

<step7> Divide both sides by 9 to find time spent looking at seals </step7>
<formula> s = 97 ÷ 9 </formula>
<calculation> 97 ÷ 9 ≈ 10.78 </calculation>
<var> seal_time : 10.78 minutes </var>
