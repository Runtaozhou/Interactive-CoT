## 1. Problem statement

Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. He knows that <fact1>an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad</fact1>, and <fact2>a child will eat half as much as an adult</fact2>. If there will be <fact3>20 adults and 5 children</fact3> at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Adult dinosaur consumption: 10 lbs of potato salad</fact1>
<fact2>Child dinosaur consumption: half as much as an adult</fact2>
<fact3>Attendees: 20 adults and 5 children</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs </step1>
<formula> number of adults × consumption per adult </formula>
<calculation> 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad </calculation>
<var> adult_potato_salad : 200 pounds </var>

<step2> Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs </step2>
<formula> number of children × consumption per child </formula>
<calculation> 5 * 10 = 50 pounds of potato salad </calculation>
<var> child_potato_salad : 50 pounds </var>

<step3> Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed </step3>
<formula> adult_potato_salad + child_potato_salad </formula>
<calculation> 200 + 50 = 250 pounds of potato salad </calculation>
<var> total_potato_salad : 250 pounds </var>
