## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Annie has 6 barrettes</fact1>, <fact2>twice as many scrunchies as barrettes</fact2>, and <fact3>three fewer bobby pins than barrettes</fact3>. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Barrettes: 6</fact1>
<fact2>Scrunchies: twice as many as barrettes</fact2>
<fact3>Bobby pins: three fewer than barrettes</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the total number of scrunchies </step1>
<formula> barrettes * 2 = scrunchies </formula>
<calculation> 6 * 2 = 12 </calculation>
<var> scrunchies: 12 </var>

<step2> Then subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes </step2>
<formula> barrettes - 3 = bobby_pins </formula>
<calculation> 6 - 3 = 3 </calculation>
<var> bobby_pins: 3 </var>

<step3> Then add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number </step3>
<formula> barrettes + scrunchies + bobby_pins = total_decorations </formula>
<calculation> 6 + 12 + 3 = 21 </calculation>
<var> total_decorations: 21 </var>

<step4> Then divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage </step4>
<formula> (bobby_pins / total_decorations) * 100% = percentage </formula>
<calculation> 3 / 21 * 100% = 14.28% ≈ 14% </calculation>
<var> percentage: 14% </var>
