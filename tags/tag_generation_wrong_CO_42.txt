## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Danivan Drugstore has 4500 bottles of hand sanitizer gel in inventory at the beginning of the week.</fact1> On Monday <fact2>2445 bottles were sold</fact2>, on Tuesday <fact3>900 bottles were sold</fact3>, and <fact4>50 bottles each day for the rest of the week were sold (from Wednesday until Sunday)</fact4>. On Saturday, <fact5>the supplier delivers an order for 650 bottles</fact5>. How many bottles of sanitizer gel does the Drugstore have at the end of the week?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial inventory: 4500 bottles</fact1>
<fact2>Monday sales: 2445 bottles</fact2>
<fact3>Tuesday sales: 900 bottles</fact3>
<fact4>Daily sales Wednesday-Sunday: 50 bottles</fact4>
<fact5>Saturday delivery: 650 bottles</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total bottles sold on Monday and Tuesday </step1>
<formula> Monday sales + Tuesday sales </formula>
<calculation> 2445 + 900 = 3345 bottles </calculation>
<var> mon_tue_sales : 3345 bottles </var>

<step2> Calculate the total bottles sold from Wednesday to Sunday </step2>
<formula> Daily sales × Number of days </formula>
<calculation> 6 * 50 = 300 bottles </calculation>
<var> wed_sun_sales : 300 bottles </var>

<step3> Calculate the total bottles sold during the week </step3>
<formula> Monday-Tuesday sales + Wednesday-Sunday sales </formula>
<calculation> 3345 + 300 = 3645 bottles </calculation>
<var> total_sales : 3645 bottles </var>

<step4> Calculate the remaining inventory before the delivery </step4>
<formula> Initial inventory - Total sales </formula>
<calculation> 4500 - 3645 = 855 bottles </calculation>
<var> remaining_inventory : 855 bottles </var>

<step5> Calculate the final inventory after the delivery </step5>
<formula> Remaining inventory + Saturday delivery </formula>
<calculation> 855 + 650 = 1505 bottles </calculation>
<var> final_inventory : 1505 bottles </var>
