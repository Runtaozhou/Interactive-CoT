## 1. Problem statement

On <fact1>Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day</fact1>. On <fact2>Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day</fact2>. In <fact3>one semester, there are 16 weeks of school</fact3>. In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes: three 1-hour classes each day</fact1>
<fact2>Tuesday, Thursday classes: two 2-hour classes each day</fact2>
<fact3>Semester length: 16 weeks</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate hours spent in class on a single Monday, Wednesday, or Friday </step1>
<formula> number of classes × hours per class </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 1 = 3 hours </calculation>
<var> daily_hours_MWF : 3 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate total hours spent in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week </step2>
<formula> daily_hours_MWF × number of days </formula>
<calculation> 3 × 3 = 9 hours </calculation>
<var> weekly_hours_MWF : 9 hours </var>

<step3> Calculate total hours spent in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the semester </step3>
<formula> weekly_hours_MWF × number of weeks </formula>
<calculation> 9 × 16 = 144 hours </calculation>
<var> semester_hours_MWF : 144 hours </var>

<step4> Calculate hours spent in class on a single Tuesday or Thursday </step4>
<formula> number of classes × hours per class </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 2 = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> daily_hours_TTh : 4 hours </var>

<step5> Calculate total hours spent in class on Tuesday and Thursday each week </step5>
<formula> daily_hours_TTh × number of days </formula>
<calculation> 4 × 1 = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> weekly_hours_TTh : 4 hours </var>

<step6> Calculate total hours spent in class on Tuesday and Thursday for the semester </step6>
<formula> weekly_hours_TTh × number of weeks </formula>
<calculation> 4 × 16 = 64 hours </calculation>
<var> semester_hours_TTh : 64 hours </var>

<step7> Calculate total hours spent in class for the entire semester </step7>
<formula> semester_hours_MWF + semester_hours_TTh </formula>
<calculation> 144 + 64 = 208 hours </calculation>
<var> total_semester_hours : 208 hours </var>
