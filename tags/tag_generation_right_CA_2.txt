## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Jean has 60 stuffies.</fact1> She keeps <fact2>1/3</fact2> of them and then gives away the rest. She gives <fact3>1/4</fact3> of what she gave away to her sister Janet. How many stuffies did Janet get?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total stuffies: 60</fact1>
<fact2>Fraction kept: 1/3</fact2>
<fact3>Fraction given to Janet: 1/4</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many stuffies Jean kept </step1>
<formula> Total stuffies × Fraction kept </formula>
<calculation> 60/3 = 20 </calculation>
<var> stuffies_kept : 20 </var>

<step2> Calculate how many stuffies Jean gave away </step2>
<formula> Total stuffies - Stuffies kept </formula>
<calculation> 60 - 20 = 40 </calculation>
<var> stuffies_given_away : 40 </var>

<step3> Calculate how many stuffies Janet received </step3>
<formula> Stuffies given away × Fraction given to Janet </formula>
<calculation> 40/4 = 10 </calculation>
<var> stuffies_to_janet : 10 </var>
