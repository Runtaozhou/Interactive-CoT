## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each</fact1> and <fact2>three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each</fact2>. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up <fact3>half of the colors from one makeup set</fact3>. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Eyeshadow palettes: 2 with 4 colors each</fact1>
<fact2>Makeup sets: 3 with 6 colors each</fact2>
<fact3>Used up: half of the colors from one makeup set</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially</step1>
<formula>palettes × colors_per_palette + makeup_sets × colors_per_set</formula>
<calculation>2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors</calculation>
<var>initial_colors: 26</var>

<step2>Subtract the colors lost when her sister stole one palette</step2>
<formula>initial_colors - colors_per_palette</formula>
<calculation>26 - 4 = 22 colors</calculation>
<var>colors_after_theft: 22</var>

<step3>Calculate how many colors were used up from one makeup set</step3>
<formula>colors_per_set ÷ 2</formula>
<calculation>6 / 2 = 3 colors</calculation>
<var>colors_used: 3</var>

<step4>Subtract the used colors from the remaining total</step4>
<formula>colors_after_theft - colors_used</formula>
<calculation>20 - 3 = 17 eyeshadow colors</calculation>
<var>final_colors: 17</var>
