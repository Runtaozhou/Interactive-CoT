## 1. Problem statement

Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into <fact1>four rounds</fact1>. Sam completed <fact2>1 more skip than Jeff</fact2> in the first round. Jeff skipped <fact3>3 fewer times than Sam</fact3> in the second round. Jeff skipped <fact4>4 more times than Sam</fact4> in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed <fact5>half the number of skips as Sam</fact5> in the last round. If <fact6>Sam skipped 16 times in each round</fact6>, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of rounds: 4</fact1>
<fact2>Sam's skips in round 1: 1 more than Jeff</fact2>
<fact3>Jeff's skips in round 2: 3 fewer than Sam</fact3>
<fact4>Jeff's skips in round 3: 4 more than Sam</fact4>
<fact5>Jeff's skips in round 4: half of Sam's</fact5>
<fact6>Sam's skips per round: 16</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 1</step1>
<formula>Sam's skips - 1</formula>
<calculation>16 - 1 = 15</calculation>
<var>jeff_round1 : 15</var>

<step2>Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 2</step2>
<formula>Sam's skips - 3</formula>
<calculation>16 - 3 = 13</calculation>
<var>jeff_round2 : 13</var>

<step3>Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 3</step3>
<formula>Sam's skips + 4</formula>
<calculation>16 + 4 = 20</calculation>
<var>jeff_round3 : 20</var>

<step4>Calculate how many skips Jeff completed in round 4</step4>
<formula>Sam's skips ÷ 2</formula>
<calculation>16 / 2 = 8</calculation>
<var>jeff_round4 : 8</var>

<step5>Calculate the total number of skips Jeff completed</step5>
<formula>jeff_round1 + jeff_round2 + jeff_round3 + jeff_round4</formula>
<calculation>16 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 57</calculation>
<var>jeff_total : 57</var>

<step6>Calculate the average number of skips per round for Jeff</step6>
<formula>jeff_total ÷ number of rounds</formula>
<calculation>57 / 4 = 14.25</calculation>
<var>jeff_average : 14.25</var>
