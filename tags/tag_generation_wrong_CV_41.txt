## 1. Problem statement

A child is making a pyramid by stacking some blocks. <fact1>In the first row, he has 9 blocks.</fact1> <fact2>For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row.</fact2> <fact3>The pyramid has 5 levels.</fact3> How many blocks did he use in all?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>First row blocks: 9</fact1>
<fact2>Each subsequent row has 2 fewer blocks than the row below it</fact2>
<fact3>Total number of levels: 5</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of blocks in the second row </step1>
<formula> first_row_blocks - 2 </formula>
<calculation> 8 - 2 = 6 blocks </calculation>
<var> second_row_blocks : 6 </var>

<step2> Calculate the number of blocks in the third row </step2>
<formula> second_row_blocks - 2 </formula>
<calculation> 6 - 2 = 4 blocks </calculation>
<var> third_row_blocks : 4 </var>

<step3> Calculate the number of blocks in the fourth row </step3>
<formula> third_row_blocks - 2 </formula>
<calculation> 4 - 2 = 2 blocks </calculation>
<var> fourth_row_blocks : 2 </var>

<step4> Calculate the number of blocks in the fifth row </step4>
<formula> fourth_row_blocks - 2 </formula>
<calculation> 2 - 2 = 0 block </calculation>
<var> fifth_row_blocks : 0 </var>

<step5> Add up all blocks to find the total </step5>
<formula> first_row_blocks + second_row_blocks + third_row_blocks + fourth_row_blocks + fifth_row_blocks </formula>
<calculation> 9 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 21 blocks </calculation>
<var> total_blocks : 21 </var>
