## 1. Problem statement

Val has <fact1>three times as many dimes as nickels</fact1>. If she accidentally finds <fact2>twice as many nickels as she has</fact2> in her older brother's treasure box, and takes them for herself, what would be the value of money she has, in dollars, if she had <fact3>20 nickels</fact3> before finding the new ones from her brother's treasure box?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Dimes to nickels ratio: 3 times</fact1>
<fact2>Found nickels: 2 times her current amount</fact2>
<fact3>Starting nickels: 20</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many more nickels Val finds in her brother's treasure box</step1>
<formula>starting nickels × 2</formula>
<calculation>2 * 20 = 40</calculation>
<var>found_nickels: 40</var>

<step2>Calculate the total number of nickels Val has after finding the new ones</step2>
<formula>starting nickels + found_nickels</formula>
<calculation>40 + 20 = 60</calculation>
<var>total_nickels: 60</var>

<step3>Calculate the value of all the nickels Val has</step3>
<formula>total_nickels × $0.05</formula>
<calculation>60 * 0.05 = $3</calculation>
<var>nickels_value: $3</var>

<step4>Calculate how many dimes Val has</step4>
<formula>starting nickels × 4</formula>
<calculation>4 * 20 = 80</calculation>
<var>total_dimes: 80</var>

<step5>Calculate the value of all the dimes Val has</step5>
<formula>total_dimes × $0.10</formula>
<calculation>80 * $0.10 = $8</calculation>
<var>dimes_value: $8</var>

<step6>Calculate the total value of all the money Val has</step6>
<formula>dimes_value + nickels_value</formula>
<calculation>$8 + $3 = $11</calculation>
<var>total_value: $11</var>
