## 1. Problem statement

Adam goes to school every day. On <fact1>Monday he had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each</fact1>, and on <fact2>Tuesday he had 3 lessons of 1 hour each</fact2>. On <fact3>Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday</fact3>. How much time in total did Adam spend at school during these 3 days, in hours?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Monday lessons: 6 lessons of 30 minutes each</fact1>
<fact2>Tuesday lessons: 3 lessons of 1 hour each</fact2>
<fact3>Wednesday time: twice as much time as Tuesday</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Monday in hours </step1>
<formula> number of lessons × minutes per lesson ÷ 60 </formula>
<calculation> 6 * 30 = 180 minutes, which is 3 hours </calculation>
<var> monday_hours : 3 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Wednesday </step2>
<formula> tuesday_hours ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours </calculation>
<var> wednesday_hours : 1.5 hours </var>

<step3> Calculate the total time Adam spent at school during the three days </step3>
<formula> monday_hours + tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours </formula>
<calculation> 3 + 3 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours </calculation>
<var> total_hours : 7.5 hours </var>
