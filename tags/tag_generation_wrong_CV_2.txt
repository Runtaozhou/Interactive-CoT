## 1. Problem statement

To celebrate a recent promotion, Arthur decided to treat himself to dinner at a nice restaurant. He ordered <fact1>a nice appetizer for $8</fact1>, <fact2>a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20</fact2>, had <fact3>two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each</fact3>, and <fact4>a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6</fact4>. He used <fact5>a voucher for half off the price of his entrée</fact5>, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress <fact6>a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount</fact6>. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Appetizer cost: $8</fact1>
<fact2>Ribeye steak cost: $20</fact2>
<fact3>Wine cost: $3 each for 2 glasses</fact3>
<fact4>Cheesecake cost: $6</fact4>
<fact5>Voucher: 50% off entrée</fact5>
<fact6>Tip percentage: 20% of full cost</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total cost of the meal before the voucher </step1>
<formula> appetizer + entrée + wine + wine + dessert </formula>
<calculation> $8 + $20 + $5 + $5 + $6 = $44 </calculation>
<var> full_meal_cost : $44 </var>

<step2> Calculate the tip amount based on the full cost </step2>
<formula> full_meal_cost * tip_percentage </formula>
<calculation> $44 * .20 = $8.8 </calculation>
<var> tip_amount : $8.8 </var>

<step3> Calculate the discount from the voucher </step3>
<formula> entrée_cost / 2 </formula>
<calculation> $20 / 2 = $10 </calculation>
<var> voucher_discount : $10 </var>

<step4> Calculate the final cost including tip and after discount </step4>
<formula> full_meal_cost - voucher_discount + tip_amount </formula>
<calculation> $44 - $10 + $8.8 = $42.8 </calculation>
<var> total_cost : $42.8 </var>
