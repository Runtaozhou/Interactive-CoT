## 1. Problem statement

Team Soccer Stars plays in a soccer league. They played a total of <fact1>20 games</fact1>, and won <fact2>14 games</fact2>, lost <fact3>2</fact3>, and drew the rest of the matches. They earn <fact4>3 points for a win</fact4>, <fact5>1 point for a draw</fact5>, and <fact6>nothing for a loss</fact6>. How many points did they have at the end of the season?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total games: 20</fact1>
<fact2>Games won: 14</fact2>
<fact3>Games lost: 2</fact3>
<fact4>Points per win: 3</fact4>
<fact5>Points per draw: 1</fact5>
<fact6>Points per loss: 0</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of games won and lost </step1>
<formula> wins + losses </formula>
<calculation> 14 + 2 = 16 games </calculation>
<var> games_won_and_lost : 16 games </var>

<step2> Calculate the number of games drawn </step2>
<formula> total games - games won and lost </formula>
<calculation> 20 - 12 = 8 games </calculation>
<var> games_drawn : 8 games </var>

<step3> Calculate the points earned from wins </step3>
<formula> wins × points per win </formula>
<calculation> 14 × 3 = 42 points </calculation>
<var> points_from_wins : 42 points </var>

<step4> Calculate the points earned from draws </step4>
<formula> draws × points per draw </formula>
<calculation> 8 × 1 = 8 points </calculation>
<var> points_from_draws : 8 points </var>

<step5> Calculate the points earned from losses </step5>
<formula> losses × points per loss </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 0 = 0 points </calculation>
<var> points_from_losses : 0 points </var>

<step6> Calculate the total points earned </step6>
<formula> points from wins + points from draws + points from losses </formula>
<calculation> 42 + 8 + 0 = 50 points </calculation>
<var> total_points : 50 points </var>
