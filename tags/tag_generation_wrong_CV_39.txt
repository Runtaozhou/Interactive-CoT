## 1. Problem statement

The rim of a standard basketball hoop is <fact1>10 feet</fact1> above the ground. Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least <fact2>6 inches</fact2> above the rim to dunk a basketball. Suppose a basketball player is <fact3>6 feet</fact3> tall and can reach <fact4>22 inches</fact4> above their head using the wingspan of their arms. How high must this player be able to jump to reach <fact5>6 inches</fact5> above the rim to dunk a basketball?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Rim height: 10 feet</fact1>
<fact2>Height needed above rim: 6 inches</fact2>
<fact3>Player height: 6 feet</fact3>
<fact4>Reach above head: 22 inches</fact4>
<fact5>Height needed above rim: 6 inches</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Convert the rim height from feet to inches </step1>
<formula> height in feet × 12 </formula>
<calculation> 11 × 12 = 132 inches </calculation>
<var> rim_height_inches : 132 inches </var>

<step2> Calculate the total height needed to dunk </step2>
<formula> rim_height_inches + height needed above rim </formula>
<calculation> 132 + 6 = 138 inches </calculation>
<var> dunk_height_needed : 138 inches </var>

<step3> Calculate how high the player can reach without jumping </step3>
<formula> player height in inches + reach above head </formula>
<calculation> 6 × 12 + 22 = 94 inches </calculation>
<var> player_reach_height : 94 inches </var>

<step4> Calculate how high the player needs to jump </step4>
<formula> dunk_height_needed - player_reach_height </formula>
<calculation> 138 - 94 = 44 inches </calculation>
<var> jump_height_needed : 44 inches </var>
