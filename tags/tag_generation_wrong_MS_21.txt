<fact2>Ida's dress: $30 more than Jean's dress</fact2>
<fact3>Jean's dress: $10 less than Pauline's dress</fact3>
<fact4>Pauline's dress: $30</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the cost of Jean's dress based on Pauline's dress </step1>
<formula> Pauline's dress - $10 </formula>
<calculation> 30 - 10 = 20 dollars </calculation>
<var> jean_dress : $20 </var>

<step2> Calculate the cost of Ida's dress based on Jean's dress </step2>
<formula> Jean's dress + $30 </formula>
<calculation> 30 + 30 = 60 dollars </calculation>
<var> ida_dress : $60 </var>

<step3> Calculate the cost of Patty's dress based on Ida's dress </step3>
<formula> Ida's dress + $10 </formula>
<calculation> 60 + 10 = 70 dollars </calculation>
