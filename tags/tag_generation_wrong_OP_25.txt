## 1. Problem statement

Lucille made an agreement with her mom that she would earn <fact1>six cents for every weed</fact1> she pulled in her mom's garden. There are <fact2>eleven weeds in the flower bed</fact2>, <fact3>fourteen in the vegetable patch</fact3>, and <fact4>thirty-two in the grass around the fruit trees</fact4>. Lucille weeded the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half the grass before she took a break. She bought a soda for <fact5>99 cents</fact5> on her break with some of her earnings. How many cents does Lucille have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Payment per weed: 6 cents</fact1>
<fact2>Weeds in flower bed: 11</fact2>
<fact3>Weeds in vegetable patch: 14</fact3>
<fact4>Weeds in grass around fruit trees: 32</fact4>
<fact5>Soda cost: 99 cents</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many weeds Lucille pulled from the grass </step1>
<formula> total grass weeds ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 32 / 2 = 16 weeds </calculation>
<var> grass_weeds_pulled : 16 weeds </var>

<step2> Find the total number of weeds Lucille pulled </step2>
<formula> flower bed weeds + vegetable patch weeds + grass weeds pulled </formula>
<calculation> 11 + 14 + 16 = 41 weeds </calculation>
<var> total_weeds_pulled : 41 weeds </var>

<step3> Calculate how much money Lucille earned </step3>
<formula> total weeds pulled × payment per weed </formula>
<calculation> 41 * 6 = 246 cents </calculation>
<var> total_earnings : 246 cents </var>

<step4> Calculate how much money Lucille has left after buying the soda </step4>
<formula> total earnings ÷ soda cost </formula>
<calculation> 246 / 99 = 2 cents </calculation>
<var> money_left : 2 cents </var>
