## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Jeremy is driving 600 miles to visit his parents.</fact1> <fact2>His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour.</fact2> Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for <fact3>15 minutes.</fact3> <fact4>His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas</fact4>, and <fact5>his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons</fact5>, at which point he stops to refill, which takes <fact6>10 minutes.</fact6> How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Distance to parents: 600 miles</fact1>
<fact2>Average speed: 50 miles per hour</fact2>
<fact3>Rest stop duration: 15 minutes</fact3>
<fact4>Fuel efficiency: 18 miles per gallon</fact4>
<fact5>Refill indicator: 15 gallons</fact5>
<fact6>Refill time: 10 minutes</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total driving time in minutes </step1>
<formula> distance / speed * minutes per hour </formula>
<calculation> 600 miles / 50 miles per hour = 12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes </calculation>
<var> driving_time : 720 minutes </var>

<step2> Determine the number of rest stops needed </step2>
<formula> driving hours / 2 </formula>
<calculation> 12 hours / 2 hours = 6 rest stops, but actually 5 rest stops at 2, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours </calculation>
<var> rest_stops : 5 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total time spent at rest stops </step3>
<formula> number of rest stops * time per rest stop </formula>
<calculation> 5 rest stops * 15 minutes per rest stop = 75 minutes </calculation>
<var> rest_time : 75 minutes </var>

<step4> Calculate how far Jeremy can drive before needing to refuel </step4>
<formula> fuel efficiency * refill indicator </formula>
<calculation> 18 miles per gallon * 15 gallons = 270 miles </calculation>
<var> miles_per_tank : 270 miles </var>

<step5> Determine how many times Jeremy needs to refuel </step5>
<formula> total distance / miles per tank </formula>
<calculation> 600 miles / 270 miles per refuel = 2.22 refuels, so he'll only make 2 refuels </calculation>
<var> refuels : 2 </var>

<step6> Calculate the total time spent refueling </step6>
<formula> number of refuels * time per refuel </formula>
<calculation> 2 refuels * 10 minute per refuel = 20 minutes </calculation>
<var> refuel_time : 20 minutes </var>

<step7> Calculate the total trip time </step7>
<formula> driving time + rest time + refuel time </formula>
<calculation> 720 minutes driving + 75 minutes resting + 20 minutes refueling = 815 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_time : 815 minutes </var>
