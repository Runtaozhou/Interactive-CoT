## 1. Problem statement

Joseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. <fact1>The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long</fact1> while <fact2>the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first</fact2>. Before the movies, <fact3>they spent 10 minutes making popcorn</fact3> and <fact4>twice as long making fries</fact4>. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>First movie length: 1 hour and 30 minutes</fact1>
<fact2>Second movie: 30 minutes longer than the first</fact2>
<fact3>Time making popcorn: 10 minutes</fact3>
<fact4>Time making fries: twice as long as making popcorn</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Convert the first movie's length from hours and minutes to just minutes </step1>
<formula> hours × 50 + minutes </formula>
<calculation> 50 + 30 = 80 minutes </calculation>
<var> first_movie_length : 80 minutes </var>

<step2> Calculate the length of the second movie </step2>
<formula> first_movie_length + 30 </formula>
<calculation> 80 + 30 = 110 minutes </calculation>
<var> second_movie_length : 110 minutes </var>

<step3> Calculate the total time spent watching both movies </step3>
<formula> first_movie_length + second_movie_length </formula>
<calculation> 80 + 110 = 190 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_movie_time : 190 minutes </var>

<step4> Calculate the time spent making fries </step4>
<formula> popcorn_time × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 10 × 2 = 20 minutes </calculation>
<var> fries_time : 20 minutes </var>

<step5> Calculate the total cooking time </step5>
<formula> popcorn_time + fries_time </formula>
<calculation> 10 + 20 = 30 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_cooking_time : 30 minutes </var>

<step6> Calculate the total time spent cooking and watching movies </step6>
<formula> total_movie_time + total_cooking_time </formula>
<calculation> 190 + 30 = 220 minutes </calculation>
<var> total_time_minutes : 220 minutes </var>

<step7> Convert the total time from minutes to hours </step7>
<formula> total_time_minutes ÷ 60 </formula>
<calculation> 220 ÷ 60 = 3.67 hours </calculation>
<var> total_time_hours : 3.67 hours </var>
