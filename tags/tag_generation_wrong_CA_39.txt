## 1. Problem statement

At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest. <fact1>Parker threw the ball 16 yards</fact1>. <fact2>Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker</fact2> and <fact3>Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant</fact3>. Compared to Parker, how much farther did Kyle throw the ball?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Parker's throw: 16 yards</fact1>
<fact2>Grant's throw: 25 percent farther than Parker</fact2>
<fact3>Kyle's throw: 2 times farther than Grant</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how much farther Grant threw compared to Parker </step1>
<formula> Parker's throw × 0.25 </formula>
<calculation> 16 * 0.25 = 4 </calculation>
<var> grant_extra_distance : 4 yards </var>

<step2> Calculate Grant's total throwing distance </step2>
<formula> Parker's throw + grant_extra_distance </formula>
<calculation> 16 + 4 = 20 yards </calculation>
<var> grant_distance : 20 yards </var>

<step3> Calculate Kyle's throwing distance </step3>
<formula> grant_distance × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 2 * 20 = 40 yards </calculation>
<var> kyle_distance : 40 yards </var>

<step4> Calculate how much farther Kyle threw compared to Parker </step4>
<formula> kyle_distance - Parker's throw </formula>
<calculation> 40 - 16 = 20 yards </calculation>
<var> kyle_extra_distance : 20 yards </var>
