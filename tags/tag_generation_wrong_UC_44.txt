## 1. Problem statement

The Parker family needs to leave the house by <fact1>5 pm</fact1> for a dinner party. Mrs. Parker was waiting to get into the bathroom at <fact2>2:30 pm</fact2>. Her oldest daughter used the bathroom for <fact3>45 minutes</fact3> and her youngest daughter used the bathroom for another <fact4>30 minutes</fact4>. Then her husband used it for <fact5>20 minutes</fact5>. How much time will Mrs. Parker have to use the bathroom to leave on time?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Departure time: 5 pm</fact1>
<fact2>Mrs. Parker waiting time: 2:30 pm</fact2>
<fact3>Oldest daughter bathroom time: 45 minutes</fact3>
<fact4>Youngest daughter bathroom time: 30 minutes</fact4>
<fact5>Husband bathroom time: 20 minutes</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the time difference between when Mrs. Parker was waiting and when they need to leave </step1>
<formula> Departure time - Waiting time </formula>
<calculation> 5:00 pm - 2:30 pm = 2.5 hours </calculation>
<var> available_time_hours : 2.5 hours </var>

<step2> Convert the available time from hours to minutes </step2>
<formula> available_time_hours × minutes per hour </formula>
<calculation> 2.5 hours × 50 = 125 minutes </calculation>
<var> available_time_minutes : 125 minutes </var>

<step3> Calculate the total time used by family members </step3>
<formula> oldest_daughter_time + youngest_daughter_time + husband_time </formula>
<calculation> 45 + 30 + 20 = 95 minutes </calculation>
<var> family_bathroom_time : 95 minutes </var>

<step4> Calculate Mrs. Parker's available bathroom time </step4>
<formula> available_time_minutes - family_bathroom_time </formula>
<calculation> 125 minutes – 95 minutes = 30 minutes </calculation>
<var> mrs_parker_bathroom_time : 30 minutes </var>
