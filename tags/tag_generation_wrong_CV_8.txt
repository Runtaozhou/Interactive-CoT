## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of puppies: 8</fact1>
<fact2>Selling price per puppy: $600</fact2>
<fact3>Payment to stud owner: $300</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many puppies John has left after giving half away</step1>
<formula>total_puppies / 2</formula>
<calculation>8 / 2 = 4</calculation>
<var>remaining_puppies: 4</var>

<step2>Calculate how many puppies John sells after keeping one</step2>
<formula>remaining_puppies - 1</formula>
<calculation>4 - 1 = 3</calculation>
<var>puppies_to_sell: 3</var>

<step3>Calculate how much money John makes from selling the puppies</step3>
<formula>puppies_to_sell * price_per_puppy</formula>
<calculation>3 * 500 = $1500</calculation>
<var>total_sales: $1500</var>

<step4>Calculate John's profit after paying the stud owner</step4>
<formula>total_sales - stud_fee</formula>
<calculation>1500 - 300 = $1200</calculation>
<var>profit: $1200</var>
