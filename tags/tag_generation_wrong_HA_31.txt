## 1. Problem statement

A group of science students went on a field trip. They took <fact1>9 vans</fact1> and <fact2>10 buses</fact2>. There were <fact3>8 people in each van</fact3> and <fact4>27 people on each bus</fact4>. How many people went on the field trip?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Number of vans: 9</fact1>
<fact2>Number of buses: 10</fact2>
<fact3>People per van: 8</fact3>
<fact4>People per bus: 27</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of people in the vans </step1>
<formula> number of vans × people per van </formula>
<calculation> 9 vans * 8 people = 72 people </calculation>
<var> people_in_vans : 72 people </var>

<step2> Calculate the total number of people on the buses </step2>
<formula> number of buses × people per bus </formula>
<calculation> 10 buses * 27 people = 270 people </calculation>
<var> people_on_buses : 270 people </var>

<step3> Add the guide in each bus to the total number of people on buses </step3>
<formula> people_on_buses + number of buses </formula>
<calculation> 270 + 10 = 280 people </calculation>
<var> total_people_on_buses : 280 people </var>

<step4> Calculate the total number of people on the field trip </step4>
<formula> people_in_vans + total_people_on_buses </formula>
<calculation> 72 + 280 = 352 people </calculation>
<var> total_people : 352 people </var>
