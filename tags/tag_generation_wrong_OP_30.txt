## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Frank picked 36 apples.</fact1> <fact2>Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank.</fact2> <fact3>Susan gave out half of her apples</fact3>, and <fact4>Frank sold a third of his</fact4>, how many in total do they have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Frank's apples: 36</fact1>
<fact2>Susan picked: 3 times as many as Frank</fact2>
<fact3>Susan gave out: 1/2 of her apples</fact3>
<fact4>Frank sold: 1/3 of his apples</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many apples Susan picked</step1>
<formula>Frank's apples × 3</formula>
<calculation>3 × 36 = 108 apples</calculation>
<var>susan_apples: 108 apples</var>

<step2>Calculate how many apples Susan gave out</step2>
<formula>susan_apples ÷ (1/2)</formula>
<calculation>108 ÷ (1/2) = 216 apples</calculation>
<var>susan_gave_out: 216 apples</var>

<step3>Calculate how many apples Susan has left</step3>
<formula>susan_apples - susan_gave_out</formula>
<calculation>108 - 216 = -108 apples</calculation>
<var>susan_left: -108 apples</var>

<step4>Calculate how many apples Frank sold</step4>
<formula>Frank's apples × (1/3)</formula>
<calculation>36 × (1/3) = 12 apples</calculation>
<var>frank_sold: 12 apples</var>

<step5>Calculate how many apples Frank has left</step5>
<formula>Frank's apples - frank_sold</formula>
<calculation>36 - 12 = 24 apples</calculation>
<var>frank_left: 24 apples</var>

<step6>Calculate the total number of apples they have left</step6>
<formula>susan_left + frank_left</formula>
<calculation>-108 + 24 = -84 apples</calculation>
<var>total_apples_left: -84 apples</var>
