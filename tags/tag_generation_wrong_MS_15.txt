## 1. Problem statement

Phil has a coin collection he likes to add to. He started with <fact1>50 state quarters</fact1> his parents gave him. Over the next year he doubled this. The following year he collected <fact2>3 each month</fact2>. The year after that he collected <fact3>1 every third month</fact3>. The year after that he lost <fact4>a quarter</fact4> of them when he misplaced his collection. How many did he have left after losing some?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Starting quarters: 50</fact1>
<fact2>Second year collection rate: 3 per month</fact2>
<fact3>Third year collection rate: 1 every third month</fact3>
<fact4>Portion lost: 1/4</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many quarters Phil had after doubling his initial collection </step1>
<formula> initial_quarters × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 50 * 2 = 100 coins </calculation>
<var> after_doubling : 100 coins </var>

<step2> Calculate how many quarters Phil collected in the second year </step2>
<formula> monthly_collection × months_in_year </formula>
<calculation> 3 * 12 = 36 coins </calculation>
<var> second_year_collection : 36 coins </var>

<step3> Calculate Phil's total before losing some </step3>
<formula> after_doubling + second_year_collection </formula>
<calculation> 100 + 36 = 136 coins </calculation>
<var> total_before_loss : 136 coins </var>

<step4> Calculate how many coins Phil lost </step4>
<formula> total_before_loss ÷ 4 </formula>
<calculation> 136 / 4 = 34 coins </calculation>
<var> coins_lost : 34 coins </var>

<step5> Calculate how many coins Phil had remaining </step5>
<formula> total_before_loss - coins_lost </formula>
<calculation> 136 - 34 = 102 coins </calculation>
<var> remaining_coins : 102 coins </var>
