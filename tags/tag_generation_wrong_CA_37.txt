## 1. Problem statement

Florida is starting a promotion where every car that arrives gets one orange per passenger. <fact1>A family of 4 arrives</fact1> and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend <fact2>$15 in total</fact2>, but now that they have the oranges they don't have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would've cost <fact3>$1.5 each</fact3>. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Family size: 4 people</fact1>
<fact2>Planned spending: $15</fact2>
<fact3>Orange cost: $1.5 each</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total cost of oranges they would have bought </step1>
<formula> number of people × cost per orange </formula>
<calculation> 4 x 1.5 = 6 </calculation>
<var> orange_cost : $6 </var>

<step2> Calculate the proportion of their original spending plan </step2>
<formula> orange_cost ÷ planned_spending </formula>
<calculation> 6 / 15 = .4 </calculation>
<var> proportion_saved : .3 </var>

<step3> Convert the proportion to a percentage </step3>
<formula> proportion_saved × 100 </formula>
<calculation> .3 x 100 = 30 </calculation>
<var> percentage_saved : 30% </var>
