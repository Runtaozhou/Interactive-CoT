<fact5>Boudin Butchers donation: one-third of Hormel's donation</fact5>
<fact6>Del Monte Foods donation: 30 fewer than American Summits</fact6>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many bottled waters American Summits donated</step1>
<formula>Foster Farms chickens × 2</formula>
<calculation>45 × 2 = 90 bottled waters</calculation>
<var>american_summits_donation: 90 bottled waters</var>

<step2>Calculate how many spams Hormel donated</step2>
<formula>Foster Farms chickens × 3</formula>
<calculation>45 × 3 = 135 spams</calculation>
<var>hormel_donation: 135 spams</var>

<step3>Calculate how many sourdoughs Boudin Bakery donated</step3>
<formula>Hormel donation × 1/3</formula>
<calculation>135 × 1/3 = 45 sourdoughs</calculation>
<var>boudin_donation: 45 sourdoughs</var>

<step4>Calculate how many canned fruits Del Monte Foods donated</step4>
<formula>American Summits donation - 30</formula>
<calculation>90 - 30 = 60 canned fruits</calculation>

<step5>Add up all donations to find the total number of food items</step5>
<formula>Foster Farms + American Summits + Hormel + Boudin Bakery + Del Monte</formula>
<calculation>45 + 90 + 135 + 45 + 50 = 365 different food</calculation>
<var>total_food_items: 365</var>
