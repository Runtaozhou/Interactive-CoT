## 1. Problem statement

A convenience store sold <fact1>100 bags of chips in a month</fact1>. In the <fact2>first week, 15 bags of chips were sold</fact2>. In the <fact3>second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold</fact3>. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many chips was each sold in the third and fourth week?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Total bags of chips sold in a month: 100</fact1>
<fact2>Bags of chips sold in first week: 15</fact2>
<fact3>Bags of chips sold in second week: thrice as many as first week</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many bags of chips were sold in the second week </step1>
<formula> first_week_sales × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 15 × 3 = 45 bags of chips </calculation>
<var> second_week_sales : 45 bags of chips </var>

<step2> Find the total number of bags sold in the first and second week combined </step2>
<formula> first_week_sales + second_week_sales </formula>
<calculation> 15 + 45 = 60 bags of chips </calculation>
<var> first_two_weeks_sales : 60 bags of chips </var>

<step3> Calculate the total number of bags sold in the third and fourth week combined </step3>
<formula> total_sales - first_two_weeks_sales </formula>
<calculation> 100 - 60 = 50 bags of chips </calculation>
<var> last_two_weeks_sales : 50 bags of chips </var>

<step4> Determine how many bags were sold in each of the third and fourth weeks </step4>
<formula> last_two_weeks_sales ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 50 ÷ 2 = 25 bags of chips </calculation>
<var> each_last_week_sales : 25 bags of chips </var>
