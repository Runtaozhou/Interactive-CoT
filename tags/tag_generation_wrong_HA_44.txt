## 1. Problem statement

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If <fact1>Bill has 60 toys</fact1>, how many total toys do the boys have?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Bill has 60 toys</fact1>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate half of Bill's toys </step1>
<formula> Bill's toys ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 60 toys / 2 = 30 toys </calculation>
<var> half_bills_toys : 30 toys </var>

<step2> Calculate Hash's toys by adding 9 to half of Bill's toys, then adding 5 more toys </step2>
<formula> half_bills_toys + 9 + 5 </formula>
<calculation> 30 toys + 9 toys = 39 toys. Assuming Hash found another 5 toys, Hash has 39 toys + 5 toys = 44 toys </calculation>
<var> hash_toys : 44 toys </var>

<step3> Calculate the total number of toys both boys have </step3>
<formula> Bill's toys + Hash's toys </formula>
<calculation> 60 toys + 44 toys = 104 toys </calculation>
<var> total_toys : 104 toys </var>
