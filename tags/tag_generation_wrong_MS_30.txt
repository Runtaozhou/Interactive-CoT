## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many paintings Marcus paints on the second day</step1>
<formula>First day paintings × 2</formula>
<calculation>2 paintings * 2 = 4 paintings</calculation>
<var>day_2_paintings: 4 paintings</var>

<step2>Calculate how many paintings Marcus paints on the third day</step2>
<formula>Second day paintings × 2</formula>
<calculation>4 paintings * 2 = 8 paintings</calculation>
<var>day_3_paintings: 8 paintings</var>

<step3>Calculate how many paintings Marcus paints on the fourth day</step3>
<formula>Third day paintings × 2</formula>
<calculation>8 paintings * 2 = 16 paintings</calculation>
<var>day_4_paintings: 16 paintings</var>

<step4>Calculate how many paintings Marcus paints on the fifth day</step4>
<formula>Fourth day paintings × 2</formula>
<calculation>16 paintings * 2 = 32 paintings</calculation>
<var>day_5_paintings: 32 paintings</var>
