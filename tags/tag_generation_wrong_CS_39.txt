## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>James earns $10 per week as an allowance.</fact1> After saving all his money for <fact2>four weeks</fact2>, he spends <fact3>half of it</fact3> on a new video game. He then spends <fact4>a quarter of what is left</fact4> to buy a new book. How much money does he have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Weekly allowance: $10</fact1>
<fact2>Saving period: 4 weeks</fact2>
<fact3>Portion spent on video game: 1/2 of total</fact3>
<fact4>Portion spent on book: 1/4 of remaining money</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total amount James saved over four weeks </step1>
<formula> weekly allowance × number of weeks </formula>
<calculation> $10 * 4 = $40 </calculation>
<var> total_savings : $40 </var>

<step2> Calculate how much James spent on the video game </step2>
<formula> total_savings / 2 </formula>
<calculation> $40 / 2 = $20 </calculation>
<var> video_game_cost : $20 </var>

<step3> Calculate how much money James has left after buying the video game </step3>
<formula> total_savings - video_game_cost </formula>
<calculation> $40 - $20 = $20 </calculation>
<var> money_after_game : $20 </var>

<step4> Calculate how much James spent on the book </step4>
<formula> money_after_game / 4 </formula>
<calculation> $20 / 4 = $5 </calculation>
<var> book_cost : $5 </var>

<step5> Calculate how much money James has left after buying both items </step5>
<formula> money_after_game - book_cost </formula>
<calculation> $20 - $10 = $10 </calculation>
<var> final_money : $10 </var>
