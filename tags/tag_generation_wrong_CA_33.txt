## 1. Problem statement

Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She promised to pay it back in <fact1>11 months</fact1> including an additional <fact2>10% of the money she borrowed</fact2>. If she pays <fact3>$15 per month</fact3>, how much money did she borrow?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Repayment period: 11 months</fact1>
<fact2>Additional payment: 10% of borrowed amount</fact2>
<fact3>Monthly payment: $15</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total amount Yoque will pay over 11 months </step1>
<formula> monthly payment × number of months </formula>
<calculation> $15 × 11 = $165 </calculation>
<var> total_payment : $165 </var>

<step2> Determine what percentage of the borrowed amount the total payment represents </step2>
<formula> original percentage + additional percentage </formula>
<calculation> 100% + 10% = 110% </calculation>
<var> repayment_percentage : 110% </var>

<step3> Calculate the value of 1% of the borrowed amount </step3>
<formula> total payment ÷ repayment percentage </formula>
<calculation> $165 ÷ 110 = $1.50 </calculation>
<var> one_percent : $1.50 </var>

<step4> Calculate the original borrowed amount </step4>
<formula> one percent × 100 </formula>
<calculation> $1.50 × 100 = $148 </calculation>
<var> borrowed_amount : $148 </var>
