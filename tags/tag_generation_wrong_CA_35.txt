## 1. Problem statement

Martin went on an <fact1>eight-hour business trip</fact1>. During the first half of the trip, he traveled at a speed of <fact2>70 kilometers per hour</fact2> and during the second half at a speed of <fact3>85 kilometers per hour</fact3>. How many kilometers did he travel during the journey?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Trip duration: 8 hours</fact1>
<fact2>First half speed: 70 kilometers per hour</fact2>
<fact3>Second half speed: 85 kilometers per hour</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the duration of half the trip </step1>
<formula> total_time × 0.5 </formula>
<calculation> 8 * 0.5 = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> half_trip_duration : 4 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate the distance traveled during the first half of the trip </step2>
<formula> half_trip_duration × first_half_speed </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 70 = 280 kilometers </calculation>
<var> first_half_distance : 280 kilometers </var>

<step3> Calculate the distance traveled during the second half of the trip </step3>
<formula> half_trip_duration × second_half_speed </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 85 = 320 kilometers </calculation>
<var> second_half_distance : 320 kilometers </var>

<step4> Calculate the total distance traveled during the trip </step4>
<formula> first_half_distance + second_half_distance </formula>
<calculation> 280 + 320 = 600 kilometers </calculation>
<var> total_distance : 600 kilometers </var>
