## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60</fact1>. If <fact2>Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen</fact2>, and <fact3>Atticus has 4 marbles</fact3>, how many marbles does Cruz have?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Three times the sum of marbles equals: 60</fact1>
<fact2>Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen</fact2>
<fact3>Atticus has: 4 marbles</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of marbles by dividing the triple sum by 3 </step1>
<formula> 60 ÷ 3 </formula>
<calculation> 60 * 3 = 180 </calculation>
<var> total_marbles : 180 </var>

<step2> Calculate how many marbles Jensen has based on Atticus's marbles </step2>
<formula> Atticus's marbles × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 2 * 4 = 8 </calculation>
<var> jensen_marbles : 8 </var>

<step3> Calculate the combined marbles of Atticus and Jensen </step3>
<formula> Atticus's marbles + Jensen's marbles </formula>
<calculation> 8 + 4 = 12 </calculation>
<var> atticus_jensen_marbles : 12 </var>

<step4> Calculate Cruz's marbles by subtracting Atticus and Jensen's marbles from the total </step4>
<formula> total marbles - (Atticus's marbles + Jensen's marbles) </formula>
<calculation> 180 - 12 = 168 </calculation>
<var> cruz_marbles : 168 </var>
