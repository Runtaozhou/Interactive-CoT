## 1. Problem statement

An avant-garde sushi house sells jellyfish for a certain amount and eel for <fact1>nine times</fact1> that amount. If the combined cost of one order each kind of sushi is <fact2>$200</fact2>, how much does the eel cost?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Eel cost: 9 times jellyfish cost</fact1>
<fact2>Combined cost: $200</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Let j be the cost of the jellyfish and e be the cost of the eel. We know that j + e = $200 and e = 9j. </step1>
<formula> j + e = $200, e = 9j </formula>
<calculation></calculation>
<var>j: cost of jellyfish</var>
<var>e: cost of eel</var>

<step2> Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get j + 9j = $200 </step2>
<formula> j + 9j = $200 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>

<step3> Combining like terms, we get 10j = $200 </step3>
<formula> 10j = $200 </formula>
<calculation></calculation>

<step4> Dividing both sides by 10, we get j = $20 </step4>
<formula> j = $200 ÷ 10 </formula>
<calculation> $200 ÷ 10 = $20 </calculation>
<var>j: $20</var>

<step5> Substituting this value back into e = 9j, we get e = 9 * $20 = $180 </step5>
<formula> e = 9j </formula>
<calculation> e = 9 * $20 = $180 </calculation>
<var>e: $180</var>
