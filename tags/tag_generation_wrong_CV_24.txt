<fact3>Jayden's lemons: 1/3 of Eli's lemons</fact3>
<fact4>Eli's lemons: 1/2 of Ian's lemons</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate how many lemons Jayden has</step1>
<formula>Levi's lemons + additional lemons</formula>
<calculation>5 + 6 = 11 lemons</calculation>
<var>jayden_lemons: 11 lemons</var>

<step2>Calculate how many lemons Eli has</step2>
<formula>Jayden's lemons × 3</formula>
<calculation>8 × 3 = 24 lemons</calculation>
<var>eli_lemons: 24 lemons</var>

<step3>Calculate how many lemons Ian has</step3>
<formula>Eli's lemons × 2</formula>
<calculation>24 × 2 = 48 lemons</calculation>
<var>ian_lemons: 48 lemons</var>

<step4>Calculate the total number of lemons</step4>
<formula>Levi's lemons + Jayden's lemons + Eli's lemons + Ian's lemons</formula>
<calculation>5 + 11 + 24 + 48 = 88 lemons</calculation>
