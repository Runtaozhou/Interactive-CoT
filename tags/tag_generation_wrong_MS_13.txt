## 1. Problem statement

Eliana walked <fact1>200 steps</fact1> for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some <fact2>300 more steps</fact2> to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked <fact3>twice the number of steps</fact3> she walked on the first day. And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional <fact4>100 steps</fact4>. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>First day first walk: 200 steps</fact1>
<fact2>First day second walk: 300 steps</fact2>
<fact3>Second day: twice the number of steps from first day</fact3>
<fact4>Third day additional steps: 100 steps</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many steps Eliana walked on the second day </step1>
<formula> 2 × (first day first walk + first day second walk) </formula>
<calculation> 2*(200+300) = 1000 </calculation>
<var> second_day_steps : 1000 steps </var>

<step2> Calculate the total steps after two days </step2>
<formula> second day steps + first day first walk + first day second walk </formula>
<calculation> 1000+200+300 = 1500 </calculation>
<var> two_day_total : 1500 steps </var>

<step3> Add the third day steps to get the total for all three days </step3>
<formula> two day total + third day additional steps </formula>
<calculation> 1500+100=1700 steps </calculation>
<var> three_day_total : 1700 steps </var>
