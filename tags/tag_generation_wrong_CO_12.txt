## 1. Problem statement

A baker bakes <fact1>5 loaves of bread an hour</fact1> in one oven. He has <fact2>4 ovens</fact2>. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for <fact3>5 hours</fact3>, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for <fact4>2 hours</fact4>. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Loaves per hour per oven: 5</fact1>
<fact2>Number of ovens: 4</fact2>
<fact3>Hours baking Monday-Friday: 5</fact3>
<fact4>Hours baking Saturday-Sunday: 2</fact4>
<fact5>Number of weeks: 3</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many loaves the baker can bake in one hour using all ovens </step1>
<formula> loaves_per_hour_per_oven × number_of_ovens </formula>
<calculation> 5 × 4 = 20 loaves of bread </calculation>
<var> loaves_per_hour : 20 loaves </var>

<step2> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes per day from Monday to Friday </step2>
<formula> hours_baking × loaves_per_hour </formula>
<calculation> 5 × 20 = 100 loaves of bread per day </calculation>
<var> weekday_loaves : 100 loaves per day </var>

<step3> Calculate the total loaves baked from Monday to Friday </step3>
<formula> weekday_loaves × number_of_weekdays </formula>
<calculation> 100 × 5 = 500 loaves of bread </calculation>
<var> weekday_total : 500 loaves </var>

<step4> Calculate how many loaves the baker bakes per day on Saturday and Sunday </step4>
<formula> hours_baking × loaves_per_hour </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 20 = 40 loaves of bread per day </calculation>
<var> weekend_loaves : 40 loaves per day </var>

<step5> Calculate the total loaves baked on Saturday and Sunday </step5>
<formula> weekend_loaves × number_of_weekend_days </formula>
<calculation> 40 × 1 = 40 loaves of bread </calculation>
<var> weekend_total : 40 loaves </var>

<step6> Calculate the total loaves baked in one week </step6>
<formula> weekday_total + weekend_total </formula>
<calculation> 500 + 40 = 540 loaves of bread </calculation>
<var> weekly_total : 540 loaves </var>

<step7> Calculate the total loaves baked in three weeks </step7>
<formula> weekly_total × number_of_weeks </formula>
<calculation> 540 × 3 = 1620 loaves of bread </calculation>
<var> three_week_total : 1620 loaves </var>
