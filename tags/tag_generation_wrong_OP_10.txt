## 1. Problem statement

Andy gets a cavity for every <fact1>4 candy canes</fact1> he eats. He gets <fact2>2 candy canes</fact2> from his parents and <fact3>3 candy canes each from 4 teachers</fact3>. Then he uses his allowance to buy <fact4>1/7 as many candy canes as he was given</fact4>. How many cavities does he get from eating all his candy canes?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Candy canes per cavity: 4</fact1>
<fact2>Candy canes from parents: 2</fact2>
<fact3>Candy canes from teachers: 3 each from 4 teachers</fact3>
<fact4>Ratio of bought to given candy canes: 1/7</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find how many candy canes Andy gets from his teachers </step1>
<formula> candy canes per teacher × number of teachers </formula>
<calculation> 3 canes/teacher * 4 teachers = 12 canes </calculation>
<var> teacher_canes : 12 canes </var>

<step2> Then add the number of candy canes he gets from his parents </step2>
<formula> teacher_canes + parent_canes </formula>
<calculation> 12 canes + 2 canes = 14 canes </calculation>
<var> total_given_canes : 14 canes </var>

<step3> Then multiply that number by 7 to find the number of canes he buys </step3>
<formula> total_given_canes × 7 </formula>
<calculation> 14 canes * 7 = 98 canes </calculation>
<var> bought_canes : 98 canes </var>

<step4> Then add the number of candy canes he gets from each source to find the total number </step4>
<formula> bought_canes + total_given_canes </formula>
<calculation> 98 canes + 14 canes = 112 canes </calculation>
<var> total_canes : 112 canes </var>

<step5> Then divide the total number of candy canes by the number of candy canes it takes to get one cavity to find the number of cavities Andy gets </step5>
<formula> total_canes ÷ canes_per_cavity </formula>
<calculation> 112 canes / 4 canes/cavity = 28 cavities </calculation>
<var> total_cavities : 28 cavities </var>
