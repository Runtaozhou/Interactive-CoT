## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>A pet store owner had 12 birds</fact1>, <fact2>9 puppies</fact2>, <fact3>5 cats</fact3>, and <fact4>15 spiders</fact4>. <fact5>Half the birds were sold</fact5> and <fact6>3 puppies were adopted</fact6>. Then, someone left the spider enclosure open and <fact7>7 of them went loose</fact7>. How many animals does the pet store owner have left?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Starting birds: 12</fact1>
<fact2>Starting puppies: 9</fact2>
<fact3>Starting cats: 5</fact3>
<fact4>Starting spiders: 15</fact4>
<fact5>Birds sold: 1/2 of total</fact5>
<fact6>Puppies adopted: 3</fact6>
<fact7>Spiders escaped: 7</fact7>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many birds are left after half were sold </step1>
<formula> Starting birds ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 12 ÷ 2 = 6 </calculation>
<var> birds_left: 6 </var>

<step2> Calculate how many puppies are left after 3 were adopted </step2>
<formula> Starting puppies - Puppies adopted </formula>
<calculation> 9 - 3 = 6 </calculation>
<var> puppies_left: 6 </var>

<step3> Calculate how many spiders are left after 7 escaped </step3>
<formula> Starting spiders - Spiders escaped </formula>
<calculation> 15 - 7 = 8 </calculation>
<var> spiders_left: 8 </var>

<step4> Calculate the total number of animals left </step4>
<formula> Cats + Birds left + Puppies left + Spiders left </formula>
<calculation> 5 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 25 </calculation>
<var> total_animals_left: 25 </var>
