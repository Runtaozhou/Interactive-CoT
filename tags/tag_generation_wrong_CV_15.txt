## 1. Problem statement

Troy bakes <fact1>2 pans of brownies, cut into 16 pieces per pan</fact1>. The guests eat <fact2>all of 1 pan</fact2>, and <fact3>75% of the 2nd pan</fact3>. <fact4>One tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops</fact4>. If <fact5>all but 4 of the guests eat the brownies ala mode (with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream)</fact5>, how many tubs of ice cream did the guests eat?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Brownies: 2 pans with 16 pieces per pan</fact1>
<fact2>Eaten from first pan: 16 pieces</fact2>
<fact3>Eaten from second pan: 75%</fact3>
<fact4>Ice cream: 8 scoops per tub</fact4>
<fact5>Guests eating ala mode: all but 4, with 2 scoops each</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total number of brownie pieces Troy bakes </step1>
<formula> pans × pieces per pan </formula>
<calculation> 2 × 15 = 30 brownie pieces </calculation>
<var> total_pieces : 30 brownie pieces </var>

<step2> Calculate how many pieces are eaten from the second pan </step2>
<formula> pieces per pan × percentage eaten </formula>
<calculation> 15 × 0.75 = 11.25 pieces </calculation>
<var> second_pan_eaten : 11.25 pieces </var>

<step3> Calculate the total number of brownie pieces eaten </step3>
<formula> first pan pieces + second pan pieces eaten </formula>
<calculation> 15 + 11.25 = 26.25 pieces </calculation>
<var> total_pieces_eaten : 26.25 pieces </var>

<step4> Calculate how many guests eat brownies ala mode </step4>
<formula> total pieces eaten - guests not eating ala mode </formula>
<calculation> 26.25 - 4 = 22.25 </calculation>
<var> guests_ala_mode : 22.25 </var>

<step5> Calculate how many scoops of ice cream are eaten </step5>
<formula> guests eating ala mode × scoops per guest </formula>
<calculation> 22.25 × 2 = 44.5 scoops </calculation>
<var> total_scoops : 44.5 scoops </var>

<step6> Calculate how many tubs of ice cream are eaten </step6>
<formula> total scoops ÷ scoops per tub </formula>
<calculation> 44.5 ÷ 8 = 5.5625 tubs </calculation>
<var> ice_cream_tubs : 5.5625 tubs </var>
