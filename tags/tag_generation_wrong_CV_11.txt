## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Josh had 100 gummy bear candies.</fact1> He decided to give <fact2>his 3 siblings 10 candies each.</fact2> Then he gave <fact3>half of the remaining candies</fact3> to his best friend. If he only wants to eat <fact4>16 gummy bear candies</fact4>, how many candies are left to be shared with others?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Initial candies: 100</fact1>
<fact2>Siblings: 3, each getting 10 candies</fact2>
<fact3>Fraction given to best friend: 1/2 of remaining</fact3>
<fact4>Candies Josh wants to eat: 16</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1>Calculate the total number of candies given to siblings</step1>
<formula>Number of siblings × Candies per sibling</formula>
<calculation>3 × 10 = 30 candies</calculation>
<var>candies_to_siblings: 30</var>

<step2>Calculate the remaining candies after giving to siblings</step2>
<formula>Initial candies - Candies to siblings</formula>
<calculation>110 - 30 = 80 candies</calculation>
<var>remaining_after_siblings: 80</var>

<step3>Calculate candies given to best friend</step3>
<formula>Remaining after siblings × 1/2</formula>
<calculation>80/2 = 40 candies</calculation>
<var>candies_to_friend: 40</var>

<step4>Calculate candies left after giving to best friend</step4>
<formula>Remaining after siblings - Candies to friend</formula>
<calculation>80 - 40 = 40 candies</calculation>
<var>remaining_after_friend: 40</var>

<step5>Calculate candies left to share with others</step5>
<formula>Remaining after friend - Candies Josh wants to eat</formula>
<calculation>40 - 16 = 24 candies</calculation>
