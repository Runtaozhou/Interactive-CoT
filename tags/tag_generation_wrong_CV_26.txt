## 1. Problem statement

Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In <fact1>May, they hired 40 employees</fact1>, paying <fact2>each employee $15 per hour</fact2> for a <fact3>40-hour workweek</fact3>. In <fact4>June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired</fact4>. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.

## 2. Facts

<fact1>May employees: 40 employees</fact1>
<fact2>Hourly rate: $15 per hour</fact2>
<fact3>Weekly hours: 40 hours</fact3>
<fact4>June contract expiration: 1/4 of employees</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the weekly pay for each employee </step1>
<formula> hourly_rate × weekly_hours </formula>
<calculation> $15 * 40 = $600 per week </calculation>
<var> weekly_pay : $600 per week </var>

<step2> Calculate the monthly pay for each employee </step2>
<formula> weekly_pay × 4 weeks </formula>
<calculation> 4 weeks * $600 per week = $2400 </calculation>
<var> monthly_pay : $2400 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May </step3>
<formula> number_of_employees × monthly_pay </formula>
<calculation> 35 * $2400 = $84000 </calculation>
<var> may_total : $84000 </var>

<step4> Calculate how many employees' contracts expired in June </step4>
<formula> total_employees × expiration_rate </formula>
<calculation> 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees </calculation>
<var> expired_contracts : 10 employees </var>

<step5> Calculate the number of employees with valid contracts in June </step5>
<formula> total_employees - expired_contracts </formula>
<calculation> 40 - 10 = 30 employees </calculation>
<var> june_employees : 30 employees </var>

<step6> Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June </step6>
<formula> june_employees × monthly_pay </formula>
<calculation> 30 * $2400 = $72000 </calculation>
<var> june_total : $72000 </var>

<step7> Calculate the total amount paid over both months </step7>
<formula> may_total + june_total </formula>
<calculation> $72000 + $84000 = $156000 </calculation>
<var> total_payment : $156000 </var>
