## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Two stores sell the same model of smartphone, but they offer it at different prices and with different discounts. Store A lists the smartphone at a full price of $125</fact1> and <fact2>offers an additional discount of 8%</fact2>. <fact3>Store B lists the same smartphone for $130</fact3> and <fact4>offers an additional discount of 10%</fact4>. After both stores' discounts are applied, how much cheaper is store A's smartphone than store B's smartphone?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Store A full price: $125</fact1>
<fact2>Store A discount: 8%</fact2>
<fact3>Store B full price: $130</fact3>
<fact4>Store B discount: 10%</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the discount amount for Store A </step1>
<formula> Store A full price × discount percentage / 100 </formula>
<calculation> $125 × 8/100 = $10 </calculation>
<var>store_A_discount: $10</var>

<step2> Calculate the final price at Store A </step2>
<formula> Store A full price - Store A discount </formula>
<calculation> $125 - $10 = $115 </calculation>
<var>store_A_price: $115</var>

<step3> Calculate the discount amount for Store B </step3>
<formula> Store B full price × discount percentage / 100 </formula>
<calculation> $130 × 10/100 = $13 </calculation>
<var>store_B_discount: $13</var>

<step4> Calculate the final price at Store B </step4>
<formula> Store B full price - Store B discount </formula>
<calculation> $130 - $13 = $117 </calculation>
<var>store_B_price: $117</var>

<step5> Calculate the price difference between Store A and Store B </step5>
<formula> Store B price - Store A price </formula>
<calculation> $117 - $115 = $2 </calculation>
<var>price_difference: $2</var>
