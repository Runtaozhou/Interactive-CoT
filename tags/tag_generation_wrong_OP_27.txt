## 1. Problem statement

Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. <fact1>Amy is 5 years older than Jackson</fact1> and <fact2>2 years younger than Corey</fact2>. If <fact3>James is 10</fact3> and is <fact4>1 year younger than Corey</fact4>, how old is Jackson?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Amy is 5 years older than Jackson</fact1>
<fact2>Amy is 2 years younger than Corey</fact2>
<fact3>James's age: 10 years</fact3>
<fact4>James is 1 year younger than Corey</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate Corey's age based on James's age </step1>
<formula> Corey's age = James's age - 1 </formula>
<calculation> 10 - 1 = 9 years old </calculation>
<var> corey_age : 9 years </var>

<step2> Calculate Amy's age based on Corey's age </step2>
<formula> Amy's age = Corey's age - 2 </formula>
<calculation> 9 - 2 = 7 years old </calculation>
<var> amy_age : 7 years </var>

<step3> Calculate Jackson's age based on Amy's age </step3>
<formula> Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5 </formula>
<calculation> 7 - 5 = 2 years old </calculation>
<var> jackson_age : 2 years </var>
