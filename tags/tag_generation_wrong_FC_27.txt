## 1. Problem statement

Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of <fact1>two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet</fact1>. If he needs <fact2>8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof</fact2>, how many shingles does he need total?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Roof dimensions: two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet</fact1>
<fact2>Shingle requirement: 8 shingles per square foot</fact2>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the area of one side of a roof </step1>
<formula> length + width </formula>
<calculation> 20 feet + 40 feet = 60 feet </calculation>
<var> one_side_area : 60 feet </var>

<step2> Then multiply that number by 2 to find the total area of both sides of the roof </step2>
<formula> one_side_area × 2 sides </formula>
<calculation> 60 feet/side * 2 sides = 120 feet </calculation>
<var> one_roof_area : 120 feet </var>

<step3> Then multiply that number by the number of roofs to find the total area of all the roofs </step3>
<formula> one_roof_area × 3 roofs </formula>
<calculation> 120 feet/roof * 3 roofs = 360 feet </calculation>
<var> total_roof_area : 360 feet </var>

<step4> Then multiply the total area of the roofs by the number of shingles needed per square foot to find the total number of shingles needed </step4>
<formula> total_roof_area × shingles per square foot </formula>
<calculation> 360 feet * 8 singles/foot = 2880 shingles </calculation>
<var> total_shingles : 2880 shingles </var>
