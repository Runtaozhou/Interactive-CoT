## 1. Problem statement

Mary is making a model sailboat. She wants to add three sails: <fact1>a rectangular sail that measures 5 inches by 8 inches</fact1> and two right triangular sails, <fact2>one that's 3 inches long at the bottom and 4 inches tall</fact2> and <fact3>one that's 4 inches long at the bottom and 6 inches tall</fact3>. How many square inches of canvas does she need total?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Rectangular sail dimensions: 5 inches by 8 inches</fact1>
<fact2>First triangular sail dimensions: 3 inches long at bottom, 4 inches tall</fact2>
<fact3>Second triangular sail dimensions: 4 inches long at bottom, 6 inches tall</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> First find the area of the square sail </step1>
<formula> perimeter calculation </formula>
<calculation> 5 inches + 5 inches + 8 inches + 8 inches = 26 square inches </calculation>
<var> rectangular_sail_area : 26 square inches </var>

<step2> Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the first triangular sail </step2>
<formula> length × height </formula>
<calculation> 3 inches * 4 inches = 12 square inches </calculation>
<var> first_square_area : 12 square inches </var>

<step3> Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail </step3>
<formula> square area ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 12 square inches / 2 = 6 square inches </calculation>
<var> first_triangular_sail_area : 6 square inches </var>

<step4> Then find the area of a square sail with the same height and length as the second triangular sail </step4>
<formula> length × height </formula>
<calculation> 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches </calculation>
<var> second_square_area : 24 square inches </var>

<step5> Then divide the area in two to find the area of the triangular sail </step5>
<formula> square area ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 24 square inches / 2 = 12 square inches </calculation>
<var> second_triangular_sail_area : 12 square inches </var>

<step6> Then add up the areas of all the sails to find the total amount of canvas needed </step6>
<formula> first_triangular_sail_area + second_triangular_sail_area + rectangular_sail_area </formula>
<calculation> 6 square inches + 12 square inches + 26 square inches = 44 square inches </calculation>
<var> total_canvas_needed : 44 square inches </var>
