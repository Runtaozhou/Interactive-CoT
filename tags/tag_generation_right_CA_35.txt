## 1. Problem statement

<fact1>Martin went on an eight-hour business trip.</fact1> During the first half of the trip, he traveled at a speed of <fact2>70 kilometers per hour</fact2> and during the second half at a speed of <fact3>85 kilometers per hour</fact3>. How many kilometers did he travel during the journey?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Trip duration: 8 hours</fact1>
<fact2>First half speed: 70 kilometers per hour</fact2>
<fact3>Second half speed: 85 kilometers per hour</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Half of the trip lasts for 8 * 0.5 = 4 hours. </step1>
<formula> half_trip_duration = total_duration * 0.5 </formula>
<calculation> 8 * 0.5 = 4 </calculation>
<var>half_trip_duration: 4 hours</var>

<step2> During the first half, Martin did 4 * 70 = 280 kilometers. </step2>
<formula> first_half_distance = half_trip_duration * first_half_speed </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 70 = 280 </calculation>
<var>first_half_distance: 280 kilometers</var>

<step3> And during the second half 4 * 85 = 340 kilometers. </step3>
<formula> second_half_distance = half_trip_duration * second_half_speed </formula>
<calculation> 4 * 85 = 340 </calculation>
<var>second_half_distance: 340 kilometers</var>

<step4> In total Martin traveled 280 + 340 = 620 kilometers during his business trip. </step4>
<formula> total_distance = first_half_distance + second_half_distance </formula>
<calculation> 280 + 340 = 620 </calculation>
<var>total_distance: 620 kilometers</var>
