## 1. Problem statement

Isabella has <fact1>three times as many green houses as yellow houses</fact1>. She also has <fact2>40 fewer yellow houses than red houses</fact2>. If she has <fact3>90 green houses</fact3>, how many of her houses are not yellow?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Green houses: 3 times yellow houses</fact1>
<fact2>Yellow houses: 40 fewer than red houses</fact2>
<fact3>Green houses: 90</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the number of yellow houses based on the number of green houses </step1>
<formula> green_houses ÷ 3 </formula>
<calculation> 90 ÷ 3 = 30 </calculation>
<var> yellow_houses : 30 </var>

<step2> Calculate the number of blue houses based on the number of yellow houses </step2>
<formula> yellow_houses - 40 </formula>
<calculation> 30 - 40 = -10 </calculation>
<var> blue_houses : -10 </var>

<step3> Calculate the total number of houses that are not yellow </step3>
<formula> blue_houses + green_houses </formula>
<calculation> -10 + 90 = 80 </calculation>
<var> non_yellow_houses : 80 </var>
