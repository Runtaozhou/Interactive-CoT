## 1. Problem statement

It's exam season and Tristan has several exams to prepare for. On <fact1>Monday, he studies for 4 hours</fact1> then studies for <fact2>twice this long on Tuesday</fact2>. On <fact3>Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day</fact3>. He wants to study for a <fact4>total of 25 hours</fact4> over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Monday study time: 4 hours</fact1>
<fact2>Tuesday study time: twice Monday's hours</fact2>
<fact3>Wednesday, Thursday, Friday study time: 3 hours each day</fact3>
<fact4>Total planned study time: 25 hours</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many hours Tristan studies on Tuesday </step1>
<formula> Monday hours × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours </calculation>
<var> tuesday_hours : 8 hours </var>

<step2> Calculate the total hours studied from Monday through Friday </step2>
<formula> Monday hours + Tuesday hours + Wednesday hours + Thursday hours + Friday hours </formula>
<calculation> 4 hours + 8 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours = 21 hours </calculation>
<var> weekday_hours : 21 hours </var>

<step3> Calculate the remaining hours to be studied over the weekend </step3>
<formula> Total planned hours - Weekday hours </formula>
<calculation> 25 hours - 21 hours = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> weekend_hours : 4 hours </var>

<step4> Calculate Saturday's study hours by dividing the weekend hours by the number of weekend days </step4>
<formula> Weekend hours ÷ Number of weekend days </formula>
<calculation> 4 hours / 1 = 4 hours </calculation>
<var> saturday_hours : 4 hours </var>
