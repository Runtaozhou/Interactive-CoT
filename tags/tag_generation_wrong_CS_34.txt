## 1. Problem statement

While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers <fact3>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3> and <fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a <fact5>combined total of 500 apples</fact5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Joanne's tallest trees apples: 30 apples</fact1>
<fact2>Joanne's shortest trees apples: half of 30</fact2>
<fact3>Sister's tallest trees apples: twice Joanne's amount</fact3>
<fact4>Sister's shortest trees apples: 3 times Joanne's amount</fact4>
<fact5>Total apples gathered: 500 apples</fact5>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees </step1>
<formula> tallest_trees_apples ÷ 2 </formula>
<calculation> 30 apples / 2 = 15 apples </calculation>
<var> joanne_shortest : 15 apples </var>

<step2> Calculate how many apples her sister gathered from the tallest trees </step2>
<formula> tallest_trees_apples × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 30 apples * 2 = 60 apples </calculation>
<var> sister_tallest : 60 apples </var>

<step3> Calculate how many apples her sister gathered from the shortest trees </step3>
<formula> joanne_shortest × 3 </formula>
<calculation> 15 apples * 3 = 45 apples </calculation>
<var> sister_shortest : 45 apples </var>

<step4> Calculate the total apples her sister gathered </step4>
<formula> sister_tallest + sister_shortest </formula>
<calculation> 60 + 45 = 105 apples </calculation>
<var> sister_total : 105 apples </var>

<step5> Calculate how many apples Joanne gathered from tallest and shortest trees </step5>
<formula> tallest_trees_apples + joanne_shortest </formula>
<calculation> 30 + 15 = 45 apples </calculation>
<var> joanne_tallest_shortest : 45 apples </var>

<step6> Calculate the combined total of apples gathered so far </step6>
<formula> sister_total + joanne_tallest_shortest </formula>
<calculation> 105 + 45 = 140 apples </calculation>
<var> apples_so_far : 140 apples </var>

<step7> Calculate how many apples Joanne must have gathered from the average trees </step7>
<formula> total_apples - apples_so_far </formula>
<calculation> 500 total apples – 140 apples so far = 360 apples </calculation>
<var> joanne_average : 360 apples </var>
