## 1. Problem statement

Candy has a chair rental business. During <fact1>the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day</fact1>; but during <fact2>weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day</fact2>. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in <fact3>two 4-week months</fact3>?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Weekday rentals: 60 chairs per day</fact1>
<fact2>Weekend rentals: 100 chairs per day</fact2>
<fact3>Time period: two 4-week months</fact3>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate the total chairs rented during weekdays in a week </step1>
<formula> weekday_chairs × 5 </formula>
<calculation> 60 × 5 = 300 chairs </calculation>
<var> weekday_chairs_per_week : 300 chairs </var>

<step2> Calculate the total chairs rented during weekends in a week </step2>
<formula> weekend_chairs × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 100 × 2 = 200 chairs </calculation>
<var> weekend_chairs_per_week : 200 chairs </var>

<step3> Calculate the total chairs rented in a week </step3>
<formula> weekday_chairs_per_week + weekend_chairs_per_week </formula>
<calculation> 300 + 200 = 500 chairs </calculation>
<var> chairs_per_week : 500 chairs </var>

<step4> Calculate the total chairs rented in a month </step4>
<formula> chairs_per_week × 4 </formula>
<calculation> 500 × 4 = 1950 chairs </calculation>
<var> chairs_per_month : 1950 chairs </var>

<step5> Calculate the total chairs rented in two months </step5>
<formula> chairs_per_month × 2 </formula>
<calculation> 1950 × 2 = 3900 chairs </calculation>
<var> total_chairs : 3900 chairs </var>
