## 1. Problem statement

Meryll wants to write <fact1>35 multiple-choice questions</fact1> and <fact2>15 problem-solving questions</fact2> for her Chemistry class. She already has written <fact3>2/5 of the multiple-choice</fact3> and <fact4>1/3 of the problem-solving questions</fact4>. How many more questions does she need to write for both multiple-choice and problem-solving?

## 2. Facts

<fact1>Multiple-choice questions: 35</fact1>
<fact2>Problem-solving questions: 15</fact2>
<fact3>Fraction of multiple-choice questions written: 2/5</fact3>
<fact4>Fraction of problem-solving questions written: 1/3</fact4>

## 3. Steps

<step1> Calculate how many multiple-choice questions Meryll has written </step1>
<formula> total multiple-choice questions × fraction written </formula>
<calculation> 35 questions × 2/5 = 14 multiple-choice questions </calculation>
<var> written_multiple_choice : 14 questions </var>

<step2> Calculate how many problem-solving questions Meryll has written </step2>
<formula> total problem-solving questions × fraction written </formula>
<calculation> 15 questions × 1/3 = 5 problem-solving questions </calculation>
<var> written_problem_solving : 5 questions </var>

<step3> Find the total number of questions Meryll needs to write </step3>
<formula> total multiple-choice questions + total problem-solving questions </formula>
<calculation> 35 questions + 15 questions = 50 questions </calculation>
<var> total_questions : 50 questions </var>

<step4> Calculate the total number of questions Meryll has already written </step4>
<formula> written multiple-choice questions + written problem-solving questions </formula>
<calculation> 14 questions + 5 questions = 19 questions </calculation>
<var> total_written : 19 questions </var>

<step5> Find how many more questions Meryll needs to write </step5>
<formula> total questions - total written questions </formula>
<calculation> 50 questions - 20 questions = 30 questions </calculation>
<var> questions_remaining : 30 questions </var>
